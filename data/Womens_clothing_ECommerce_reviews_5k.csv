Waist gets baggy with wear,"I really liked these jeans initially, but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.",General,Bottoms,Jeans
So long!!,"I am of average height, but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print, but i don't think it's worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!",Initmates,Intimate,Lounge
Slip is too small...,"Dress is pretty, i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep, i am returning. :(",General,Dresses,Dresses
Didn't look good on me,Thought i would try this as other reviewers loved it and it's out of my comfort zone. it looked like a poncho with a baggy tank underneath. not worth the price. the tassels looked a bit worn as well.,General,Tops,Knits
Dress,"I love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height (5'4""). i'm thinking about having it altered, not sure if i will do that or return it. i love the colors and the back cut out, it may be a better length for taller individuals.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
"Cute, but didnt love",It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy,General,Tops,Sweaters
See through,I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,General Petite,Intimate,Lounge
Disappointed,"Sleeves were tight, was difficult to put on ?. for the price, you want to love the shirt. sending it back.",General,Tops,Blouses
Renaissance fair vibe,"I was disappointed by this dress. i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up, a size 6 instead of my usual 4, and that was the correct size. fit like a glove. unfortunately, the style left much to be desired. this dress is very costume-y. i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair. not a good vibe. it is a beautiful dress, i'm not denying that, but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event. there's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric. i a",General,Dresses,Dresses
Had high hopes!,"I had sized down because i'm usually a petite, but didn't have the option for petite here, and it was still too big. a petite or an additional size down could have helped the fit, but in the end the style wasn't what i was going for. the dress has a little more texture going on than what is revealed in the photo here on the site -- i thought it was a luxurious brocade fabric, but the shininess actually comes from silky threads on a mesh-ish overlay. it's a lovely, quality dress, and the color is",General,Dresses,Dresses
Too big,"I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.",General,Tops,Knits
Very delicate,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,General,Tops,Blouses
Runs small,"Purchased on sale, would have never purchased at full price. runs small and runs short. will be returning.",General,Tops,Knits
See through,"This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through - i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra. it seems very flimsy and poor quality, even at the sale price. disappointed and will return...",General Petite,Tops,Knits
Could have been great but just ok,"Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also, it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however, because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.",General,Tops,Knits
No shape,"I wanted to love this dress, however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through, so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
"Runs small, too much distressing","I have a few pairs of the stevie ankle, so i thought i try these. they have very little stretch and feel tight in the waist. the distressing near the front pockets is really apparent...like white stripes. they make the jean look overall cheap. not worth $198, in my opinion.",General,Bottoms,Jeans
Bulky and big,"The material, deep color and design are gorgeous. however, the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2"" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p, and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Really wanted to like it,"The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work, but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(",General,Tops,Knits
Worst peplum top in history,"This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for",General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Enormous....,"I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy, but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer, and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly, this will be going back.",General,Tops,Knits
Unflattering,"Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.",General Petite,Jackets,Outerwear
Very sheer and shorter than shown,"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

I wanted to love it.,"I read the other reviews before i purchased this jumpsuit because it's very cute. as another 5'3"" reviewer mentioned it will be longer so for me that's a plus but i have thighs, not huge but regular well proportioned woman thighs and boobs. it was a little tight but doable around my thighs but my boobs got ""lost in the sauce"". i gotta love it to keep it and i don't. it's a great print and fabric though.",General,Bottoms,Pants

This sweater is everywhere!,"And not in a good way. everywhere i went, i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on, i was picking balls of fabric off the couch, bed, and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style, fabric and fit (although a little on the long side,) but there's no way i can keep it.",General,Tops,Fine gauge
Perfect jogger!,Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
Weird fit in the bust,I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Really small,This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.,General,Bottoms,Skirts
"Runs big, a bit sloppy looking and overpriced.","I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well, and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down, but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
"No, just no.","I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately, it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and, it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet, but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly, it is going back.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Love this!!!,"Tried it on at the store. (must of been a return) at first i wasn't thrilled with this dress.. have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this. the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly. went to a 5 hour dinner that night and was so comfortable. not itchy and i felt very pretty in it. husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again. would not of ordered this online, so glad it was in store. much more vibrant in person . try it you will lik",General,Dresses,Dresses
Great shirt,Love this shirt. great shape and lightweight material for hot houston weather. washes up nice but does need some ironing.,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Different from picture,"What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design, however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem, it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive, it looks white on the picture, but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.",General,Tops,Knits
Completely wonky,"I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.",General,Dresses,Dresses

Wrinkles,"This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant, but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Poor quality,"This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however, on the third wear, the side zipper split wide open. needless to say, it was returned.",General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
Great too but not for women who have a large bust.,It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
"Orange color is pretty, quality is poor","I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.

the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived, new in the packages, with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin, as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area",General,Tops,Fine gauge

"Too wide, too short",This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,General,Jackets,Jackets
Cute but not for anyone bigger than a b cup,I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.,General,Dresses,Dresses

Awkward,"Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view, i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.",General,Tops,Knits
Poof,This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.,General,Tops,Sweaters
I really wanted to love this top!,"I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me.",General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Disappointing,"Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front, but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft, but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look, but sadly this is going back.",General Petite,Tops,Blouses

Not for everyone,"The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s",General Petite,Tops,Blouses

Love this dress,"I am 6'2"" and athletically built, and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me, but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length. it is very flattering. the weight of the dress allows it to move with you. it is form-fitting, but loose at the same time, so your body doesn't look lost in the material. you can dress it up with heels, or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual.",General,Dresses,Dresses

Cute piece for fall,I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. it's very cute and on trend. can't wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!,General Petite,Tops,Blouses

"Beautiful color, poor design in the back","I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color, and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though, the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back, but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though, so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top",General,Dresses,Dresses
Too large and not flattering,The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.,General,Tops,Blouses
Coral roll top sweater.,This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.,General Petite,Tops,Sweaters

but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there, a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part, between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look, and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.

Thick material,I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Not worth the price,"I got this shirt in stores because it went on sale! i was excited to wear it, but it felt a little long on me. i decided that after a regular wash, it would help it. after washing, it shrunk way more than my other retailer clothes! now the arm straps feel really tight and the fabric lost its flowy-ness. it's a classic shirt, but it may not be worth the price for the quality of the fabric. be careful when washing.",General,Tops,Knits

Great design with cheap fabric. not worth it.,"Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews, even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black, you could probably get away with it, but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.",General,Tops,Blouses

"Pretty, but stiff",This dress you will want to try on in the store. it is very thick and stiff fabric. the whole front is embroidered and the big drawback for me is that waist seam. there is absolutely no give in that waist. this is not stretchy fabric and not easy for just any body type to wear. sad because it is very pretty on the rack!,General,Dresses,Dresses

I agree with the whimsy,"Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.",General,Tops,Sweaters

Hospital white lace on top of taupe sweatshirt,"The fit of the top is true to size, but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy, but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail, i'm absolutely sending it back.",General,Tops,Knits

Strangely cut,"Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Total muumuu,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful, but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere, my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me, as well. possibly great for pregnancy, because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.",General,Dresses,Dresses
"Cheap, thin fabric. too bad.",Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.,General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
Poor quality,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,General Petite,Tops,Knits
Disappointing,"After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Perfect maternity top!,"Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all, it's not a happy orange, it a darker rust.  second, it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.",General,Tops,Blouses
"Love this artist's work, not the material for this","I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried, i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy",General,Tops,Fine gauge
Very cute but cheaply made,"Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size, but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought, better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well, literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam",General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
Disappointed,"When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Epic,"I love this top. in fact, when i saw in the store, i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home.",General,Tops,Blouses
Cute and comfy,"As t-shirts go, this one has a flattering fit...shapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show. i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now, so will have to be careful when washing. if it were available, i would have tried the large, so if you're a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing. it's a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are great....the v dips just like the photo - approprialty sexy and age appropriate (i'm 62, 5'3"" at 125",General Petite,Tops,Knits
Interesting cut,"These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5"" and the size 4 fit in the waist, but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on, they're also very poofy right below the waist.",General,Bottoms,Pants

Nice design but not that great,"Online, i like the design, the leaves stand out. in-person, the leaves don't stand out as much, you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame, i think. it was just too light and thin for me.",General,Tops,Knits
Unflattering - too flowy,This dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it's huge. and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down. the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge. i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering. it was also much longer than it looks on the model. i'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy.,General,Dresses,Dresses
Comfortable and pretty,"I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright, not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose, the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau",General,Dresses,Dresses
Huge,"I love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version, but it was huge and shapeless.  nice material and fabric but this one is going back.",General,Tops,Knits
Pretty but cheap,"These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.

they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.

when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way",General Petite,Intimate,Lounge
It won't fit over the chest,"I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large, i usually wear a large, and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad, it looked adorable and i was so excited to try",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Doesn't wash well,"I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.",Initmates,Intimate,Sleep

"Very thin fabric, pretty disappointing","I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy, soft cotton, but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath, which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra, but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra, which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to",General,Tops,Blouses
Flower sack,"This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad, it's such a pretty combination of patterns.",General,Trend,Trend

Not worth the price,"I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.",General,Tops,Blouses

Perfect fall blouse,I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer. the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange. looks great on its own as well as under a cardy. this will be in heavy rotation.,General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Ok i get it now,This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on. love it! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way. colors are great. got the petite size. the pattern is different for each one so each is unique. mine has. lot more navy blue.,General,Bottoms,Pants
Huge,"I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i""m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large.",General,Tops,Blouses
Average top,"This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on, it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side, gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also, it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.",General Petite,Tops,Knits
Great top for taller gals,"Tried this one because the ruffled detailing at the collar and sleeves appealed to me, as well at the cute button details along the back and the overall color and look of it.

pros:
- love the ruffle trim along the collar, bottom, and wrists. it gives it a really romantic feel to it.

Too big,"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10"". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t",General,Tops,Blouses
Did not fit,"I'm a pretty solid 10 these days (and had no trouble fitting into other size 10 dresses at the store). the large was so tight around my hips. i barely got it on. they didn't have an xl to try on, but i can't imagine i would have fit in it. so, if you have wide hips, this is not the dress for you. it fit fine on top in the l, it was just so tight in the hips that it did not lay nicely.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Not skinny enough to wear this,Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.,General Petite,Tops,Knits

Cute style but poor quality,"I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small, particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2, but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look, but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally, the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Too thin,I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.,General,Tops,Knits
"Pretty, but going back","I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.",General,Bottoms,Skirts
Extremely long!,"Lovely fabric, color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can't even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don't buy sewing or ironing).

Almost there...,"Really wanted to love this, especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived, the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper, but going to have to return.",General,Tops,Knits

Not last year's cut,"I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately, the cut is different. the sides, covered here by the model's hands, flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted, being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt",General,Bottoms,Shorts

Not flattering,"I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted, but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through.

Not side zip and huge!,"I ordered these because of the side zipper, but they zip in front, even though the order listing and bag label called them ""wine, side zip pants."" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back, even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.",General Petite,Bottoms,Pants
Pills horribly,"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.",General Petite,Intimate,Lounge

Hidden tailoring faux pas,"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.

Gigantic and heavy!,"I purchased this sweater in my usual xs, but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff, too, so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also, the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small, but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou",General Petite,Tops,Sweaters

Not flattering on straight figures,"Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit, you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me, it may work better on curvier figures.",General,Dresses,Dresses

Cute vest but cheap material.,"This vest looked so cute online. what you can't see however, is the vertical seaming under the arms does not have any fringe (about 3"" wide). that material in the seaming area looked like cheap polyester and it pulled slightly near the side pockets so it didn't lay nicely. also the top of the vest where it comes together also does not lay well and it falls awkwardly open - again showing the cheapy material that it's lined with. fits true to size. i usually wear a s/m in retailer and purchased the",General,Jackets,Jackets

"Again, my bad for not looking at description...","I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.

"Lovely concept, lack of attention to detail","Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!), and worse, the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread, which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.

Small cup sizes for frame,The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,Initmates,Intimate,Swim

Adorable,"Just so i'm clear, the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion, but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online, it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.

Not for tall hourglass body types,"I was bummed about this dress! i saw it online and loved both colors. i tried it on in the store, and it did not work for me. i am 5'8"" tall with an hourglass figure, and it was too shot and too loose. it looked like a babydoll nightgown. i wanted to love it, but i think this one only works on smaller frames. onto the next...",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Simple classic,"I bought the burgundy color in this shirt dress. usually wear a size 4 and xs in most brands. purchased the xs in this dress. i'm 5'4, 118#, 34d. the fabric is rayon however it feels more like a light flannel or soft brushed cotton. like you've worn it forever. the length says 40"" long but i found when worn with the belt it rides up substantially. about 2-3 inches above the knee. felt like i was squirming to pull it down. i normally wouldn't be drawn to something so simple but when i walked out",General,Dresses,Dresses
Not worth the money,I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.,General,Tops,Sweaters

Beautiful shirt on model but no,"I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide, i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely, i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.",General,Tops,Knits
Do not wash,Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.,General,Tops,Knits
Amazing and it has pockets!!!,I saw this dress online and thought it might be an adorable eclectic piece to add to my closet. and was i right. the simple shape mixed with the bold pattern make this dress an awesome one to own. its easy and fun and funky. plus it has hidden pockets! beware though this dress seems to run a bit small. i would say if you switch in between sizes like me i can be a 6 or an 8 then possibly go with the larger size. i do have a large bust as well i wear a 34ddd so it shows some clevage but the girls,General,Dresses,Dresses
Disappointing,"I had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size. i found the colors and print a bit blah (i felt like it could use a little detail for the price...bead detail or embroidery) in real life and i didn't love the fabric, in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesn't drape particularly well. things got worse in the dressing room...it was a disaster on me. i'm busty and while the top fit, because",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Stylish little sweater,"I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink, this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference, i am 5'1, 36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.",General Petite,Tops,Fine gauge
Not for my body type,"I own the essential slims and love them, so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t",General,Bottoms,Pants

Poor quality,The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,General,Tops,Blouses

Blue lining and awkward arm holes,"The dress i received has a blue lining under the patterned chiffon, unlike the white lining that is pictured. the back of the dress is more open than it appears in the pictures so the blue lining and the large exposed zipper is a significant portion of the dress design. also, the arm holes are cut short which makes the dress feel awkward on. the quality of the dress is very high.",General,Dresses,Dresses

Low quality for price,"This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable",Initmates,Intimate,Swim

No shoulder mobility,"1st, this jacket fits true to size. 2nd, the shoulders are too tight (design--not sizing), as other reviewers have noted. it's such a beautiful design and material, so it's unfortunate that the shoulders are so tight the jacket is a little impractical.

Cute in theory,"Cute in theory, i love the bright colors, the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe, however, the fabric is cheap, and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional, but with the shirt i received, it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam, so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on",General,Tops,Blouses

Unwearable,"I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n",General,Tops,Blouses

Odd cut,"I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up, the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also, the actual neck part was tight. for reference, i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.",General Petite,Trend,Trend

Not mid waist,"These corodorys are considered mid waist but i interpret them as the perfect height for the low waist or regular rise. other than that, they are beautiful so comfortable not stretchey yet not constricting. i'm 5'6"" 107lb got a size 25 and i need a belt in the waist but the butt and legs are perfect and the waist isn't too big just not constricting. i always get urban outfitter corodorys but this year their quality is bad and these made of up it 100% plus the length is perfect",General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans
Disappointed,"Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.",General,Dresses,Dresses

"Pretty, but cheap feeling","I liked the look of the tunic sweater, and it was very soft. i am 5'7, 115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight, but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings, and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft, but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.",General Petite,Tops,Sweaters
Love!!,"I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.",Initmates,Intimate,Layering

Top is too shear with see through front,This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,General,Tops,Blouses

Too sheer,"The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer, but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4"" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Not doing anything for me,"Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.",General,Tops,Blouses

Bad lining,"This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on, i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline, which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :(",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Nothing to rave about,"This sweater is ok. i love, love, love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring, but once it arrived, i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also, it's a bit itchy for me-but i'm rather sensitive and if i'd loved this on",General,Tops,Sweaters
Beautiful top ruined by styling,"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came",Initmates,Intimate,Layering

Scratchy and unflattering,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo, it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider, which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.",General Petite,Tops,Sweaters

Weird fit,"I love jumpsuits and was excited about this one because i liked the print/colors and that it's long-sleeved. i ordered my usual medium size (i'm a solid medium). it was a tad tight in the rear/thigh area (not flattering when you have a thin material which shows every bump unlike jeans) but the length (i'm 5'5"") and top fit well. i returned it and ordered the large but the waist was huge (and that's coming from a person with a bit of a tummy bulge) and there isn't anything to cinch the waist in.",General,Bottoms,Pants
Disappointing,"This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely, but it was too short for me (5'7"") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly, too, the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it, which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you, great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter",General,Tops,Sweaters

Not sure,"I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand, my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top, so hoping i'll end up loving it!",General Petite,Tops,Knits
Not my favorite,"Not in love with this one. the fabric is thin and seems cheap... it seems overpriced even on sale. and it runs a bit small along the bust. i could maybe get away with it without a bra, but after 3 kids, braless isn't my best look. and i don't think the print is a pretty in person as it is online - can't quite put my finger on why... maybe a little darker in person. that said, the fit is flattering. the cinched waist is lovely, and the skirt is nice and flowy. even so, this one is going back.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Husband said it looked like a straight jacket,"This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better, but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.",Initmates,Intimate,Sleep
Huge,"Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.",General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Too much fabric,"I saw the shirt at my local retailer store and loved the color and print; however, the shirt had way too much fabric!  i was swimming in it.  it was not flattering whatsoever.  plus, it's overpriced for a shirt.  i'm sadly returning it.",General,Tops,Knits
Priced too high,I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.,General,Tops,Knits
Looked a bit like drapes,"Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also, the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately, it has to go back.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Built in saddlebags,"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",General,Jackets,Jackets

Disappointing quality,"I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.",General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans

I so want to love this shirt...,"...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.",General Petite,Tops,Blouses

Beauiful dress!,This dress does fit small.. i am generally a size 10-12 in maeve but purchased this in a 14. i have a large chest (34g) which contributed to my need to size up. the green color is beautiful and the dress looks darling on. i have a little trouble with the zipper but nothing that required me to return the dress. my biggest complaint is that the straps are a tiny bit too long and don't lie flat on my shoulders. other than that i receive a ton of compliments every time i wear it!,General,Dresses,Dresses
Awful if you have any sort of curves!,"I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it, it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup, the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Flattering,"I love this dress-i have it in the other color (black and white) but now i see this color scheme and i think i may actually like this one better. i love the wider stripes near the waistline which gives it a slimming appearance. the knotted look gives this dress a beachy feel which gets me in the mood for summertime. i love that the pattern is bold, but the color scheme allows this dress to still stay in the casual category and still be insanely flattering. i love that i could wear this dress eve",General,Dresses,Dresses
Beautiful top,"I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.

Shapeless and itchy sweater,"I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters",General Petite,Tops,Sweaters
Oversized tshirt,"I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue, but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide, shapeless, and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite, i'm not sure it's worth the price, because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Would have loved in summer,"I had this in my wish list a long time, ten when sale came along, my size was sold out. however, someone returned it at my local store. i purchased it then tried it on later... why i ended returning it:

fabric was gorgeous, and light, but fall is coming, and i won't wear it until next summer. may get over it by then
the shape is really nice, but the hem hit me in a weird spot on my short muscular legs
as others mentioned, there are spots where the sewing is not ""perfect"" and bulges a little",General,Dresses,Dresses
"Cute shirt, but not cute on my figure","I have more of an athletic figure, and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute, otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.",General Petite,Tops,Knits
Wanted to love it,"Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut",General,Tops,Blouses
Not soft,"I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.",General,Tops,Sweaters
"Beautiful fabric, huge cut","The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes.",General,Tops,Blouses
"Soooo cute, but short rise.","I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.",General,Bottoms,Pants

Nothing like pictures,"I was so excited to try this on after having discovered it on the retailer app and stepping into the store and seeing it. on the hanger it looked alright, but once i slipped it on, it's like everything i've got going for me disappeared. granted, i'm s little bottom heavy, so these types of dresses don't typically flatter my body type anyways.",General,Dresses,Dresses
"Lovely top, but too tight",The top is a pretty design. it's a low v-neck. but it would be nice for layering. it was just way to tight. runs small. order up a size.,Initmates,Intimate,Layering
Lovely but armholes too revealing for me...,"Wished this had worked for me! however, i prefer smaller armholes so my bra and skin (not so young anymore) don't show. the beige lining shows at the armholes as well. on the upside, it's very slimming even with the stiff petticoat. so cute! perfect length for me. another caveat -- if your back is not completely symmetrical, as mine isn't, the decorative back straps sit in a wonky position. i'm 98 lbs, 4' 10"", and the oop was perfect but for the above objections.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Mission impossible,"What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt, and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes, i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.",General,Bottoms,Skirts
Lovely skirt!,Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!,General Petite,Bottoms,Skirts
Love this,"I am 5'4"", 170lbs, 34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty, and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty, and doesn't cling. i love it!",General,Tops,Knits
"Really, really horrible, try again, retailer!","I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible, unflattering, and laughable! please try again with this one, retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!",General,Tops,Knits
It fits!,"I ordered this dress to wear for summer weddings this year. i am both surprised and excited that it fits.

i normally wear an 18, sometimes a 16. stores like retailer are a place i go to admire fun cloths, but not to actually shop. i was concerned that the xl was going to be a fake xl- this happens sometimes. a brand only makes clothing up to a 12, so they're xl is really a 12. but not so! i feel like the xl could fit a 16 - 20. the l would probably fit a 16 as well.

Beautiful dress; so excited to wear it!!!,"I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them, i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut ""keyhole."" i am sooo happy with my purchase.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Scratchy,"The sweater is cute, but scratchy.",General,Tops,Sweaters
"Cute idea, bad cut",I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.,General Petite,Tops,Blouses

Not good for sensitive skin,"I saw online, great quality sweater dress- reviews about seemingly extra fabric- easy fix with a seamstress. i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters. wool, angora, mohair! 5'1, xsp, tts (length/arms) but lots of extra fabric for width. just trying it on was too itchy for me.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Weird fit,"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.",General,Tops,Blouses
Baggy and shapeless,"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those, ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful",General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Not flattering if you have thighs!,I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.,General,Bottoms,Pants
Itchy and oversized,"I'm 5'5 and 130lbs and i was swimming in the small. the arms are very boxy, the sleeves too long, and and it just wasn't a flattering fit at all. the color and design on the front are both nice. the sweater is made in china and very, very itchy. i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers, but there was no way this was going to be comfortable. very disappointed, especially given the price, but perhaps that's why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale. this one is going bac",General,Tops,Sweaters
Very large; lace is kinda coarse,"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back.",General,Tops,Blouses
Fits like a giant tent,"The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.",General Petite,Tops,Fine gauge
Disappointing blouse,"I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy, i didn't like the fabric, and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.",General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Nope!,Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,General Petite,Tops,Sweaters
Too billowy,I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
No shape,"I loved the idea of this dress, but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting, but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs, and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.

the material is soft, but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Versatile!,"I didn't expect to love this dress.. i assumed it would be something i'd return. this dress is so cute on! i love how well it fit me and that i could dress it up for work with booties, or pumps and a cardigan or dress it down for happy hour or a baby shower. i ordered a small ( i am 5'4 and 130 lbs) and it fit me like a glove....good job maeve you did it again!",General,Dresses,Dresses
"Unnatural feeling fabric, slim fit","Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast"", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle",General,Tops,Knits
Not for the very petite,"I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Jeunet,"I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1"", 140lbs, 36d, 39"" hips. i'd need an xl.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Make sure you handwash or dry clean only,"Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.",General,Tops,Sweaters

Roomy yet flattering,"This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream. the mixed knit contrast trim/hood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there. it's a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers. the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking, that's why i picked 'runs large' as you'd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look. if i could afford to buy the other color now i would. i wish retailer would commission a green version. and a brown version. red too. what the heck,",General Petite,Tops,Sweaters
Nice top but fabric not that good,"This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.",General,Tops,Blouses

Disappointing quality,"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t",General Petite,Intimate,Lounge

Quality & cut,"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6"" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",General,Tops,Knits

Ill fitting,"Like some other reviewers, i, too, have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself, i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust, and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps, i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool, and i was rea",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Goofy neck,The quality and color is great on this top.  the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look.  and to wear it as a cowl neck (or actually looks like a boat neck) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look.  it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right.  the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other.,General,Tops,Knits

Exquisite,"Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it, perfect holiday party dress!",General,Dresses,Dresses
Super short shorts...,"Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.",General,Bottoms,Shorts
Meh,"I wanted to love this top, but had 2 major problems with it. first, it's not for short girls. i'm only 5' tall and it was a total mess on me proportion wise. the sleeves were way too long and the seam where the sweater and peplum meet hit right in the middle of my butt, which was terribly unflattering. second, the grey fabric was very thin and kinda cheap looking. no regrets on returning this one.",General,Tops,Knits

Odd shaped coat with stripped bands sewn in,Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.,General,Jackets,Outerwear

Sizing is off,"I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top, with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.",General,Dresses,Dresses

Cute but,"It was a little on the thinner side (fabric), a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back, i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable, and the back is beautiful (love bows), tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price, even on sale, i didn't feel i absolutely needed it, but if you are looking for a hite tank, it is pretty cute.

Really oddly shaped sweater!,"I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely, more of a grayish blue, and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good, as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger, so it does sit on your hips, however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape",General,Tops,Fine gauge
Love at first sight,"I knew once i saw this online that i would love it, because of that i almost feel like my review is biased. i have been searching for a jacket like this for awhile. i own the holding horses version from a few years back, but that one is just not fitted enough in the waist for me (even though it has a drawstring waist). this one too has an interior drawstring waist and it is more fitted in the waist giving the feminine appearance i desire. but it's not too tight. i am small up top, 34b but larger",General Petite,Jackets,Jackets
Not flattering,"I didn't think top was very flattering and, while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd. this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom...just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful. sadly this one is going back to the store.",General Petite,Tops,Knits
Some things you should know...,"First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3"" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot",Initmates,Intimate,Sleep
Go to pattern,"I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems",General,Tops,Blouses

Bummed out,"Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way, came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material, recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size, my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Disappointing,"This dress has beautiful lines. i loved the design on the material, but the fabric looked very cheap & even was already snagged when it arrived. unfortunately, i must return it.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Shapeless,"This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined, but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim, which means i have large shoulders, and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion, well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long, and as usual, retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system, so if you choose to close this cardigan, it just looks awful.",General,Tops,Sweaters
Perfect for mediterenian summer,Ordered these online and they fit perfectly. i was looking for lightweight pants for hot and humid summer days and this pair is exactly what i needed. the striped pattern is cute and adds some color.,General,Bottoms,Pants
Color is more a mauve rather than a light pink,"Perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine, comfy and goes with everything. only problem is color is not like picture. it is a mauve not a light pink. i still love this top and the color it camre in. brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick. highly recommend. a winner!!!",General,Tops,Knits
Unflattering for pear shapes,"I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews, i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately, it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest, and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.",General Petite,Tops,Knits
Great for travel,"I think the model is wearing a larger size, per the first review. i am 5'2"" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap, since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it.",General,Tops,Sweaters
You don't know what you get until you get them...,"Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger",General,Trend,Trend
Light and lovely but not for me,"This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures, but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so, perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally, and this wasn't so much of a con and just something to note, the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the",General Petite,Tops,Blouses
Lightweight and unique,"This shirt is absolutely beautiful! the front is very thin and delicate, but wearing a nude bra underneath, you can't see a thing. i did need to add a snap between the top two buttons to avoid the chest ""gap"" but the back of the shirt offers enough stretch that it doesn't appear to ""pull"" at all. it's hard to find a button down that fits nicely when your short waisted and large chested. this one is it!!!!",General,Tops,Knits
Farm animal pullover,"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic, but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling, ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer.",General,Tops,Fine gauge
Sizing is all over the map!,"If you happen to get a size that fits you, you will love these leggings. they are true to size when the quality control works. i got 2 pair, both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans! the material is very soft and comfortable. also, not sure who named these colors, but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple.",General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans
Not what it appears,"I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work, and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad, but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small, or xs in most shirts, and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though, and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.",General,Tops,Knits
Cute and versatile,Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.,General,Tops,Knits
Bummer!,"Ugh, i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!",General Petite,Tops,Knits
So unflattering,"I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too, to see if they wanted it or liked it better, but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses,i just don't think is cut well.",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Plan to size way up,"I'm a rather small person--5'2"", about 100 lbs, 32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place, i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs, planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee, but even as petite as i am, i coul",General,Tops,Knits
Runs large...until you wash it,"I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.",General,Tops,Knits
Not a tunic,"This fits like a regular top for me. i can take petite on top most of the time. i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops. i think it's so cute on. it's light weight enough for warmer weather. i'm going to love it this spring/summer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan. another plus is it doesn't gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts. it's not so low cut on me either, but i have a 32f (37-38ish inches) bust so that may be why? it",General,Tops,Knits
Huge!!,These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(,General Petite,Bottoms,Jeans

Size up and you'll love it,"I was eyeing this one for a while. based on the style and other reviews, i did order one size up. i think it would have been too small [catch on the hips] in my regular size. i do wish it was a little longer, too. the back is fine because it's longer. it's definitely wearable though. i wouldn't recommend it for a work function if you're a bit taller. despite all of that, i really do like dress. it's a new favorite. i ordered the blue --- love the dot pattern. i wore it with brown booties and it",General,Dresses,Dresses
"Ice cream, you scream!","I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really, truly adorable. unfortunately, the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b, ladies, so be warned!) at the same time, the arm holes were huge, i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise, you'll for sure nee",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses

Heavy material,I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.,General,Dresses,Dresses

"Cute patterns, potato-sack fit","I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute, but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack, big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad, i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Very disappointing!!!!,"I've been eyeing this dress for months, so when it went on sale i finally purchased it. now i see why it's on sale.

"Close, but no","I really, really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however, it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress, i can't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Looks great off but not on,Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.,General,Dresses,Dresses

Yuck,"This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.

a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.",General,Bottoms,Skirts
Too much of a goodthing,"Too much of a good thing is...still too much. there's too much flounce on this jacket for me--the waist sits slightly high, and the incredible amount of fabric beneath it (when you twill around, it's basically a full circle) makes my hips look huge. if there were about 1/3rd (not 1/2, but 1/3) the amount of fabric to the skirt, i'd be totally in love.

Odd...,"So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust, even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top, but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern, color, and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!",General Petite,Dresses,Dresses
Great style | not so great construction,"Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however, i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.",General,Dresses,Dresses
Itchy!,"This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however, one i put it on, i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also, the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down.",General,Tops,Sweaters
"Very cute print/style, but weird cut on top","I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well, but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model, it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however, that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit, and when left in, my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out, m",Initmates,Intimate,Swim
Thin material,"I wanted so badly to love this dress, but i couldn't get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated, and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn't accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though, the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning, but alas will be returning.",General,Dresses,Dresses

Not what i expected,"I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store, i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on, the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy, but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that, and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low, so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides

A wallpaper potato-sack,"The title says it all. while the quality was good, when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5""), which was ok, but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs, which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!",General,Dresses,Dresses
"So small, so sad.","I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year, similar to these, so when i saw this fun pair, i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.

My new favorite jacket,"I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here. it looks like something my grandma would wear. in person, however, this jacket is so versatile. the fabric moves with your body,and the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want. i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs (which i also adore), and it's absolutely perfect. color goes with everything. i'll wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall, too. great",General,Jackets,Jackets
