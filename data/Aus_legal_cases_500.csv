Case15689,cited,Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 170,"Relevant principles in the context of claimed breach of s 52 , as explained by the Full Court in SAP Australia [1999] FCA 1821 ; 169 ALR 1 at 14, include the following: &#8226; Initial confusion is sufficient and it is not necessary for confusion to induce or be likely to induce a transaction. Conduct which misleads a customer so that, under some mistaken impression of a trader's connection or affiliation, he or she opens negotiations or invites approaches may be misleading or deceptive even if the true position emerges before the transaction is concluded. &#8226; However, each case depends on its own facts and conduct may not be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive, notwithstanding that it may engender temporary and commercially irrelevant error (cf Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 170 at [56] ; Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181 at [41] ). &#8226; Characterisation of conduct as ""misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive"" involves a judgment of a notional cause and effect relationship between the conduct and putative consumer's state of mind. 71 In addition to these principles, it is also clear that: &#8226; In order to determine whether there has been any contravention of s 52 it is necessary to determine whether or not the conduct complained of amounted to a representation which has or would be likely to lead to a misconception arising in the minds of that section of the public to whom the conduct has been directed: Astrazeneca Pty Ltd v GlaxoSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 22 at [34] . &#8226; Whether or not there is the requirement of some exclusive reputation as an element in the common law tort of passing off, there is no such requirement in relation to Pt V of the TPA. The question is not whether an applicant has shown a sufficient reputation in a particular get-up or name. The question is whether the use of the particular get-up or name by an alleged wrongdoer in relation to his product is likely to mislead or deceive persons familiar with the claimant's product to believe that the two products are associated, having regard to the state of knowledge of consumers in Australia of the claimant's product: Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Limited (2007) 159 FCR 359 at 419; Hansen Beverage Company v Bickfords (Australia) Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 181 at [39] . &#8226; Where the relevant conduct involves representations to the public at large or to a section thereof, such as prospective purchasers of a product the respondent markets or proposes to market, the issue is one of identifying the ""ordinary"" or ""reasonable"" members of that class of prospective purchasers: Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; [2000] 202 CLR 45 at 84-85. &#8226; It is necessary to isolate by some criterion a representative member of the class of prospective purchasers: Campomar [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at 85. This excludes erroneous or fanciful assumptions: Campomar [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at 86. &#8226; Where a transitory association between the names of two products in the mind of a member of the public is immediately dispelled upon a comparison of those products, this brief association will generally be of no significance and therefore will not give rise to misleading conduct or deception: Knight v Beyond Properties Pty Ltd [2007] FCAFC 170 at [53] ."
Case9347,applied,Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252,"The term 'serious hardship' is not defined in the Act. In Powell v Evreniades (1989) 21 FCR 252 (' Evreniades ') Hill J considered the term as used in s 265 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). His Honour, who was concerned with serious hardship to a taxpayer's dependants upon the death of the taxpayer, observed, at 258: 'There is no definition in s 265 of what is meant by 'serious hardship' nor would one expect there to be. Each of the words in the phrase is an ordinary English word having a well understood meaning. The context in which the words appear makes it clear that the Relief Board is to consider whether the exaction of the full amount of tax would involve the dependants of a deceased taxpayer in financial difficulty which in all the circumstances can be said to be serious. The financial difficulty will be such that the dependants will be in significant need warranting action by the Relief Board to relieve their condition.' 14 Hill J accepted that there was a distinction between extreme and serious hardship noting that what will constitute either will depend on the circumstances. His Honour also said it was inappropriate to attempt to state tests of what would constitute 'serious hardship' in the abstract and commented, at 259: 'Clearly there would be severe financial hardship if the dependants of a deceased person were left destitute without any means of support. That is not to say that in any particular case something less than that will not constitute serious hardship.' These observations were referred to with apparent approval by Gummow J in Van Grieken v Veilands (1991) 21 ATR 1639 at 1644. 16 In the Amended Notice of Appeal the applicant complains that the Tribunal used the 'wrong test' in determining the prospect of 'serious hardship' for the respondent. In its written submissions it expressed its complaint somewhat differently saying that the Tribunal 'misunderstood the meaning' of the term. It seems to me that the latter expression is less likely to lead to confusion as it recognises, at least implicitly, that ""serious hardship"" is itself the test that has to be applied to an applicant's circumstances to decide if that applicant is eligible for relief from a tax debt. There is no other test, although there may be issues about which factors, in the particular circumstances, are or are not relevant to this determination. It is because the assessment is based so squarely on the individual circumstances that Hill J in Evreniades thought it was inappropriate to try and identify, in the abstract, the circumstances that would give rise to serious hardship. 17 This is not to say that guidance cannot be given by examples in which the test of serious hardship would clearly be met. In Evreniades, Hill J gave such an example when he recognised that there would be 'severe financial hardship' if persons were left 'destitute without any means of support'. The Taxation Ruling gives a similar example when it says that there would be serious hardship if a taxpayer were left 'without the means to achieve reasonable acquisitions of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements'. I do not see any inconsistency in these examples. Effect must be given to the qualification of 'reasonable' in the Taxation Ruling and, consistently with the reasoning of Hill J, these examples do not exclude the possibility that something less than destitution will constitute serious hardship. Whether this is so depends on the particular circumstances of each case. 18 It is not entirely clear that the Tribunal appreciated that the Taxation Ruling allowed for consideration of individual circumstances. In commenting on the Ruling the Tribunal said that 'it is no more than policy and cannot bind this Tribunal'. This comment seems to suggest that the Tribunal misunderstood the Ruling as providing a rigid rule. As I have already explained, I do not think that this is the correct interpretation of the Ruling but, as the Tribunal did not apply any such rigid rule, the misunderstanding is not of present concern. 19 The applicant submitted that the Tribunal's rejection of the Taxation Ruling indicates that it used some other unidentified test of serious hardship to make its decision. I do not accept this submission. The Tribunal noted that what is needed for proper maintenance and support is a relative question that can only be answered with regard to the whole of the taxpayer's circumstances. The Tribunal considered all the relevant aspects of the respondent's circumstances including whether he could achieve 'acquisitions of food, clothing, medical supplies, accommodation, education for children and other basic requirements' that were not excessive or unreasonable in all the circumstances. I do not accept that the Tribunal used the wrong test. 59 The Tribunal was aware that it had discretion to grant or withhold relief even it was satisfied on the serious hardship point. This is made clear by the Tribunal's quoting from the decision of Hill J in Evreniades, where his Honour said at 262-263: 'It follows from Trebilco that in the course of consideration of the release of tax under s 265 the Board may consider not only such matters as go to the issue of serious hardship but also other matters which in the discretion of the Board may be relevant, those other matters being merely proscribed by the general principle that the discretion must be exercised bona fide and for the purposes for which it was conferred, there being jurisdiction in this Court to intervene if in the overall exercise of the discretion the Board does take into account considerations which having regard to the purposes served by s 265 , can be seen to be irrelevant,' 60 I am satisfied that the Tribunal did exercise its discretion. Although the issue of discretion is not addressed under a separate heading there is sufficient indication of this throughout the Tribunal's reasons for me to be satisfied that this is so. 61 It was accepted on all sides that the respondent's debt had not arisen because of avoidance or participation in any scheme. The applicant submitted, however, that the Tribunal failed to take into account that the respondent had earned substantial amounts of money in the relevant period without making adequate provision for his tax liability. The transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal shows that the Tribunal questioned the respondent about the issue. The respondent talked at length about the difficulties he had in the law firm where the income that gave rise to the tax debt was generated. He said that the firm had the capacity to reduce his income retrospectively so that amounts that he was anticipating he would receive did not materialise. He also referred to difficulties he had experienced on a family level in moving from interstate at a time when his wife's illness, with consequent medical expenses, first manifested itself. At the same time one child's learning difficulty and another's serious heart condition (now resolved) were diagnosed. The combination of these factors led to his neglecting his financial affairs and not realising that a debt was accumulated. His subsequent drop in income made it impossible to meet the debt."
Case8483,cited,Wigan v English and Scottish Law Life Assurance Association (1909) 1 Ch 291,"to sue for an antecedent debt pursuant to an agreement, either express or implied, may constitute valuable consideration, including in a bankruptcy context: Wigan v English and Scottish Law Life Assurance Association (1909) 1 Ch 291 at 303, re Zampatti ex parte RJ Levack Ltd [1993] FCA 170 , Cannane &amp; Anor v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (1996) 65 FCR 453 at 466, Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Racovitis [1995] FCA 959 , Victorian Producers Co-Operative Co Ltd v Kenneth [1999] FCA 1488 , Phillips Fox (A Firm) v Westgold Resources NL [2000] WASCA 85 at [22] . However in bankruptcy-related proceedings the forbearance must be for value. This point was emphasised in para 84.14 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 (Cth), which enacted s 120 in its current form, states: Forbearance to sue has always been regarded at law as good consideration. Such forbearance will, under the Act as proposed to be amended by the Bill, have to be looked at in the light of the likely value of the chose in action. (emphasis added)"
Case11187,cited,Roufos v Andrea (1981) 57 FLR 10,"In determining whether a bankruptcy notice could reasonably mislead a debtor the court is not confined to an examination of the notice; it may look at facts extraneous to the notice, including the terms of an earlier bankruptcy notice served on the debtor; see Re Wimborne; Ex parte the Debtor (1979) 24 ALR 494 (Lockhart J); Clyne v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1982) 42 ALR 703 (Lockhart J); Roufos v Andrea (1981) 57 FLR 10 at 15-16 (Deane, Fisher &amp; Fitzgerald JJ)."
Case1695,applied,Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404,"Commonwealth v Northern Land Council [1993] HCA 24 ; (1993) 176 CLR 604 , a public interest immunity case about documents recording cabinet deliberations, the Court said at 620: There was, therefore, no call for Jenkinson J to order that the documents be produced for inspection. But we would add that, even if there had been, the procedure of ordering production of documents for inspection by the legal representatives of one of the parties, even upon a restricted basis, before the claim for immunity had been decided by the court, was open to serious question. Whatever the safeguards, it represents an encroachment upon the confidentiality claimed for the documents. And in this case, public interest in their immunity from disclosure was of the highest order. If inspection of documents is necessary to determine the question of immunity (and in this case it was not) then it ought to be carried out by the court before ordering production for inspection by a party. No doubt this may in some cases cast a heavy burden on the court, but it is unavoidable if confidentiality is to be maintained until a claim for immunity is determined. See also Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 469 and Gypsy Jokers Inc v Commissioner of Police (WA) [2008] HCA 4 ; (2008) 234 CLR 532 at [180] and [185] per Crennan J. Northern Land Council and Alister concerned inspection by the court of the documents over which privilege was claimed. In Gypsy Jokers Crennan J spoke more broadly of ""information in documents"", ""certain material relied on for determination of a proceeding"" and ""confidential material before a court"", which was not revealed to a party seeking it. In The Queen v Bebic (unreported, 27 May 1982) the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales dealt specifically with the disclosure of the contents of an affidavit tendered in support of a public interest immunity claim. There Samuels JA, Nagle CJ at CL and Cantor J said at 4: Mr Mason tendered an affidavit in support of his claim for privilege. He submitted, however, that the affidavit should not be placed on the file, that is to say that it should be read only by the Court and not disclosed to the party calling, on the footing that the contents of the affidavit would or might themselves compromise the claims for privilege. We had and still have some doubts about the propriety of restricting the affidavit in the way proposed. However, it may well be that that course is, in certain cases, of which this is one, no more than a logical extension of the established practice of the Courts inspecting the allegedly privileged documents itself. Later at 5, after saying that the Court had read both documents in question and the affidavit in support of the claim for privilege, their Honours said: It seems to us that granted that it is now commonplace for judges to make a private inspection of documents in order to resolve a claim for privilege ..., it follows that in a proper case the judge may similarly keep to himself the affidavit by which the claim is supported. The Court then ordered that the affidavit remain sealed up with the papers on the ground that to disclose its contents might prejudice the claim for privilege. I have referred in connection with the respondent's affidavit to the great importance that is attached to the respondent's opinion as to the damage to national security incident upon disclosure. Obviously that is also the case in relation to the disclosure of the documents over which privilege is claimed. I have summarised the respondent's reasons for his opinion about the possible effects of disclosure of the documents in question. This is all derived from the open parts of his affidavit. The Final Appreciations and related briefing notes set out the reasoning process that underlies the making of security assessments, which are the key mechanism by which ASIO advises government that particular individuals pose a threat to national security. If documents falling within this class were required to be produced, ASIO would be giving information about its knowledge, assessments and methodology to the very people to whom it is most important that national security information is not disclosed: cf Alister 154 CLR at 454-455 per Brennan J. As the respondent has deposed, the relevant class is ""one of the classes of documents held by ASIO that require the greatest level of protection"" first, because of the inherent sensitivity of the information that is routinely contained in such documents, and second, because of the detrimental consequences in terms of the quality of decision-making that would be likely to follow if ASIO officers were forced to omit particular kinds of information from Final Appreciations and related briefing notes due to the risk that those documents will become available to persons the subject of security assessments. The applicants contended that the respondent was not able to make a class claim. It was said that he seeks to describe as a class claim documents which he considers constitutes a Final Appreciation and documents related thereto. That description, they say, does not constitute an identifiable class. The table in the affidavit (set out at [9]) refers to an internal email, an internal minute and a briefing note. It does not refer to any Final Appreciation. By way of contrast, the applicants assert that Cabinet documents constitute a clear class claim. Here they say the so-called class claim involves the respondent asserting for himself that particular documents constitute Final Appreciations. I do not think that is a fair description of the respondent's claim. The presently relevant parts of his affidavit are as follows: (a) shortly after identifying the documents in the table at [9] he describes them on a class basis as ""paradigm examples of documents that ASIO should not be required to disclose save in exceptional circumstances""; (b) the results of complex security assessments are usually contained in a Final Appreciation document, though it may not be headed in that way; (c) the Final Appreciation ordinarily takes the form of an ASIO minute; (d) when the investigative branch assesses an individual to be a threat to Australia's national security, the respondent is advised, usually by a DGBN; (e) often both a DGBN and a Final Appreciation are provided to the respondent for decision; (f) it is the document on which a security assessment is based, being the Final Appreciation (however that document is headed) and any associated DGBN that cannot be disclosed; (g) the class claim advanced concerns the class of documents shortly described as ""Final Appreciation documents and related briefing notes""; (h) documents in this class invariably contain specific detail as to why persons are assessed as a risk to national security, and specific details of intelligence sources and methods; (i) the respondent has examined the ASIO documents, namely those in the table (the class claim) and the contents claim documents; and (j) the disclosure of the documents in (i) would prejudice Australia's national security for the reasons stated in the affidavit."
Case8744,followed,Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 261,"Fundamental to the Tribunal's decision was its understanding that the relevant test of ""substantial compliance"" was as discussed in Baidakova v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436 at 6. The Tribunal applied the ""substantial compliance"" test to Condition 8202(3)(b). However, the requirement in Condition 8202(3)(b) to provide a certificate cannot, logically, be satisfied by substantial compliance. Either Condition 8202(3)(b) is satisfied or it is not; either there is a certificate of an ""at least satisfactory"" academic result or there is not ( Jayasekara v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 167 ; (2006) 156 FCR 199 per Heerey and Sundberg JJ). It is not in dispute that the education provider, the University of Sydney ('the University') had not provided the necessary certificate. There was no compliance with Condition 8202(3)(b). There is ' no scope for operation of the distinction between strict compliance and substantial compliance ' in determining whether Item 8202(3)(b) of Sch 8 of the Regulations is satisfied ( Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 261 at [10] , cited in Jayasekara at [5])."
Case17126,cited,Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684,"The Applicant contends that there is no power to revoke the s 16 notice: Dutton v Republic of South Africa [1999] FCA 498 , 162 ALR 625 ; Tervonen v Minister for Justice and Customs (No 2) [2007] FCA 1684 at [108] , [2007] FCA 1684 ; 98 ALD 589 (Varied: Minister for Home Affairs v Tervonen [2008] FCAFC 24)."
Case15828,cited,NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10,"The appellant says a proper inference can not be drawn from the country information relied upon by the Tribunal that an applicant for a passport is of no interest to PRC authorities on grounds of prior protest conduct for reasons of political opinion, simply because the applicant obtains a passport and achieves an objective of lawfully leaving China. However, five things should be noted. First, the Tribunal was entitled to prefer the country information it obtained and rely upon it in discharging its fact-finding role ( NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 [11] and [41], relying upon VTAG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 91 ; (2005) 141 FCR 291 and VAO v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCA 161 at [25] ). Secondly, the finding is primarily supported by the Tribunal's assessment of the appellant's evidence. Thirdly, the appellant accepted that he had not engaged in protest activity and explained the conjunction of circumstances causing that to be so. Fourthly, even if no proper inference arises out of the older country information, the Tribunal did not act on 'no evidence' in reaching its finding as evidence (that is, the appellant's own evidence) supported the finding. Fifthly, the question of whether there is any evidence of a particular fact is a question of law just as whether a particular inference can be drawn from facts found or agreed is a question of law. Accordingly, in the context of judicial review, the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. On the other hand, clearly enough, there is no error of law in simply making a wrong finding of fact. In addition, even if the reasoning upon which the decision-maker reached its conclusion of fact is demonstrated to be unsound, that would not amount to error of law ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al-Miahi [2001] FCA 744 ; (2002) 65 ALD 141 per Sundberg, Emmett and Finkelstein JJ at [34]). Even if it is accepted that the earlier country information did not support an inference drawn by the Tribunal, there was nevertheless evidence before the Tribunal supporting the findings of fact."
Case982,cited,Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229,"Court's discretion to order costs under s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) is unfettered, except that it must be exercised judicially. The usual order as to costs is that a successful party will have its costs paid on a party and party basis by the unsuccessful party: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-234. As the passage from Cretazzo indicates, the mere fact that a substantially successful applicant fails on particular issues of fact or law along the way may not afford an adequate ground for depriving that applicant of some or all of its costs. On the other hand, it lies within the Court's discretion to make a costs order that reflects the degree of success attained: Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 at 234-235 [11] and 236 [15].

Case2768,cited,Re Application by PPI Industries Pty Ltd (1989) 17 IPR 667,
Case15887,referred to,Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VR 37,"I do not think that Pioneer Concrete is of assistance on the present point. The issue there was an alleged breach of restraint of trade covenants and required the Court to consider the difference between acts preparatory to the carrying on of a business and carrying on a business. Independent Management is more helpful. The plaintiff in that case alleged that a former employee had misused confidential information obtained during her employment and had breached her duty of fidelity. The employee had successfully tendered for a contract previously held by the plaintiff. Marks J said that the skill and information gained by the defendant was outside the protected category. He referred to the following observations of Gowans J in Ansell Rubber Co Pty Ltd v Allied Rubber Industries Pty Ltd [1967] VR 37 (at 40): In this field a distinction has to be maintained between information and knowledge acquired in confidence by an employee during his employment which he uses or discloses for his own advantage while he is still an employee, and information and knowledge so acquired which he uses for his own advantage after his employment is finished. A further distinction has to be drawn between information which forms part of the employee's stock of general knowledge, skill and experience, and that which should fairly be regarded as a separate part of the employee's stock of knowledge (whether it be identifiable as ""particular"" or ""detailed"" or ""special"") which a man of ordinary intelligence and honesty would regard as the property of the former employer."
Case22059,applied,Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225,"The High Court (Dawson, McHugh and Gummow JJ, with Brennan CJ and Kirby J dissenting) in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 ( Applicant A ) held that such fear would not constitute persecution for a Convention reason. 24 In Applicant A , the Tribunal had accepted as a matter of fact that coercive measures were used in the implementation of China's family planning policy, and that coercive measures ranged from forms of civil discrimination to fines and forced contraception, sterilisation and abortion: see at 251. The Tribunal defined the social group in question as "" those who having only one child do not accept the limitations placed on them or who are coerced or forced into being sterilised ."" 25 The majority in the High Court held that persons who oppose China's one child policy and feared sterilisation did not constitute a ""particular social group"", because the uniting feature was a fear of persecution. 26 Dawson J said in his reasons, at 243: In this case, the reason the appellants fear persecution is not that they belong to any group, since there is no evidence that being the parents of one child and not accepting the limitations imposed by government policy is a characteristic which, because it is shared with others, unites a collection of persons and sets them apart from society at large. It is not an accurate response to say that the government itself perceives such persons to be a group and persecutes individuals because they belong to it. Rather, the persecution is carried out in the enforcement of a policy which applies generally. The persecution feared by the appellants is a result of the fact that, by their actions, they have brought themselves within its terms. The only recognisable group to which they can sensibly be said to belong is the group comprising those who fear persecution pursuant to the one child policy. For the reasons I have given, that cannot be regarded as a particular social group for the purposes of the Convention. 27 McHugh J said, at 269-270: If, as is probably the case, the Tribunal meant by ""those who ... do not accept the limitations placed on them"" those couples who believe that they should be able to have more than one child notwithstanding the government's policy, there is nothing to link the couples so as to create a perception that they constitute a particular social group. There is simply a disparate collection of couples throughout China who want to have more than one child contrary to the one child policy. Some may wish to have a child as soon as possible; some in the near future; and others in the distant future. There is no social attribute or characteristic linking the couples, nothing external that would allow them to be perceived as a particular social group for Convention purposes. To classify such couples as ""a particular social group"" is to create an artificial construct that bears no resemblance to a social group as that term is ordinarily understood. 28 And Gummow J said, at 285: I would assume, for the purposes of the determination of this appeal, that the PRC has a ""one child policy"", infringement of which attracts, as a matter of governmental decision, the sanctions feared by the appellants. I assume therefore that there exists a policy which is being implemented in a fashion which engulfs a number of persons for whom the PRC is their country of nationality. On that footing, a disparate collection of parents, and those desiring to be parents, who do not accept and have difficulties in complying with a ""one child policy"" are at risk of the application of a general law of conduct required by the state and, on the assumptions I have made, brutally enforced. But they are not members of a particular social group with a fear of persecution by reason of membership thereof. 29 The only distinguishing feature between Applicant A and the present case is the form of persecution feared, namely, the appellant in the present case fears compulsory abortion as opposed to compulsory sterilisation. 30 Gummow J said, at 286, that "" ... the form the persecution takes should not 'be inserted into the definition of the social group .'"" 31 Consistent with the judgment of the High Court in Applicant A , the Tribunal, while accepting that ""the applicant has been badly persecuted in the past"", concluded that the appellant had not pointed to any harm which would amount to persecution which she fears she will suffer for one or more of the five Convention reasons if she returns to China. 32 Similarly, before the Federal Magistrates Court, Scarlett FM records, in [29] of his Honour's reasons: Counsel for the Minister, Ms Sirtes, submitted that the Applicant, whilst she had made quite clear that she did not wish to return to China, had not demonstrated any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal and submitted that the Applicant's unfortunate circumstances did not provide any ground for remitting her application to the Tribunal. 33 Scarlett FM held that Ground 2 of the appellant's appeal was "" ... really a challenge to the Tribunal's factual findings "", and therefore no case of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal had been made out. 34 This is not a challenge to a factual finding by the Tribunal. The Tribunal held, however, that mistreatment amounting to persecution for breach of the ""one child"" policy was not persecution because of membership of ""a particular social group"", and therefore the appellant did not fall within the definition of a refugee. 35 The legal position is plain. The appeal to this Court from the Federal Magistrates Court has to be dismissed with costs."
Case7636,cited,Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464,"For an issue estoppel to arise, (1) the same question of fact or law must necessarily have been decided; (2) by a judicial decision that was final; and (3) the parties to the earlier judicial decision or their privies must be the same persons as the parties in which the estoppel is raised; see Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34 ("" Kuligowski "") at [21]; Blair v Curran [1939] HCA 23 ; (1939) 62 CLR 464 ("" Blair v Curran "") at 531 532. 47 It is also true that this finding necessarily established the legal foundation or justification for the conclusion which his Honour reached; it was legally indispensable to the conclusion; see Blair v Curran at 531 532."
Case9791,referred to,Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197,"support can be gained from the well-known ""ticket cases"" in the law of contract. Those cases establish that where an exemption clause is contained in a ticket, and the other party is not actually aware of the terms of the clause when the contract was made, the party seeking to rely on it cannot do so unless, at the time when the contract was made, reasonable notice was given to the other party: see Seddon and Ellinghaus, Cheshire and Fifoot's Law of Contract (9 th Australian Edition, 2008) at [10.28] and [10.70]; Oceanic Sun Line Special Shipping Company Inc v Fay [1988] HCA 32 ; (1988) 165 CLR 197 at 228-229. This principle has no application here, because as the authors of Cheshire and Fifoot observe at [10.71], it is necessary to determine with some precision at what point the contract was made. That cannot be done in the present case. What the composers and EMI would need to establish is that Ms Sinclair submitted her entry after the publication of the circular or after the July edition of Matilda and that each of those publications constituted reasonable notice. Having regard to Ms Sinclair's close connection with the Victorian Girl Guides, it is mere conjecture to say that this is what happened. It is equally probable that she heard of the competition by word of mouth and submitted her entry before the publication of those documents. Accordingly, it has not been established on the evidence that Ms Sinclair entered into a contract in writing on the terms contained in the circular, or, at least, that the contract included the term which provided for all ""matter"" to be the property of the Victorian Girl Guides. It follows that there was no assignment in writing to satisfy the requirements of s 5(2) of the British Copyright Act ."
Case23239,cited,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609,"In relation to these grounds of appeal, the submissions of the appellant can be summarised as follows: &#8226; the information relied on by the Tribunal was that the appellant could have gone to India immediately upon receiving her passport in 2003 without obtaining a visa. This appeared in response to the appellant's statement in a statutory declaration that she did not have a visa to depart Nepal. The information upon which the Tribunal relied, namely that she could leave Nepal without a visa, was not merely the conclusion or thought processes of the Tribunal &#8226; it is clear from the decision of the Tribunal that this information undermined the appellant's claim that Australia owed her protection obligations, and accordingly it was within s 424A as considered by the High Court in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609 as it was not information which fell within the exception in s 424A(3)(a) &#8226; information the Tribunal had with respect to Nepalese citizens entering India was limited to information the Tribunal had concerning whether it is possible to fly directly from Australia to India with a Nepalese passport. The relevant information upon which the Tribunal relied did not deal with circumstances in which a Nepalese person could enter India from Nepal. 26 In response, the respondent submitted in summary: &#8226; the statements of the Tribunal with respect to the ability of the appellant to leave Nepal with her passport was not ""information"" within the meaning of s 424A(1) , but rather the subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations of the Tribunal: VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 476, SZBYR 235 ALR at 616 &#8226; if these statements, including with respect to the ability of the appellant to go to India, were ""information"", it was information within s 424A(3)(a) &#8226; even if the statements were ""information"" within the meaning of s 424A(1) the Tribunal did not act in breach of the section in that it brought to the appellant's attention the fact that she could have left Nepal when she received her passport. Did the Tribunal rely on ""information"" within the meaning of section 424A(1)? 29 The factual basis of ""information"" was reiterated by the majority of the High Court in SZBYR 235 ALR at 616 where their Honours said in relation to ""information"" in s 424A(1): ""However broadly 'information' be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence."" 30 It is not in dispute that ""information"" for the purposes of s 424A(1) does not include ""subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations"" of the Tribunal: SZBYR 235 ALR 609. ""Subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations"" include for example: &#8226; the Tribunal's disbelief of an applicant's evidence arising from inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence ( SZBYR 235 ALR at 616, Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Applicant A125 of 2003 [2007] FCAFC 162 , VAF 206 ALR at 476, WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276) &#8226; a determination by the Tribunal that the applicant's account is or may not be credible ( Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 , Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 428) &#8226; a determination of the Tribunal that the information provided by the applicant in the original application lacks specificity and detail: VAAM v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 120 &#8226; a view taken by the Tribunal as to the unsatisfactory nature of answers provided by an applicant: NADH of 2001 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 328."

Thus, a bank which gives its customers financial advice in the course of a transaction that includes an advance of money to the client may be in a fiduciary relationship with the client in its role as adviser.

The Court in SZEEU treated the discussion of the word 'information' in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 ("" VAF "") as a point of departure for its own consideration of the appeals before it.

Case5988,cited,Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283,"The discretion of the Court conferred by the words 'or within such further time as the court concerned allows' appearing in s 46PO(2) HREOC Act is similar to the discretion given to the Court in s 11(1) Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (' ADJR Act '). Principles applicable to the exercise of the discretion under s 46PO(2) were described by McInnis FM in Phillips v Australian Girls Choir [2001] FMCA 109 , based in turn on principles formulated by Wilcox J in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348 in relation to s11 ADJR Act . These considerations articulated in Phillips have been applied in a number of Federal Court decisions including Pham , Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited [2005] FCA 1541 (Jacobsen J) and Ingram-Nader v Brinks Australia Pty Limited [2006] FCA 624 (Cowdroy J), and are relevant in the case before me. The principles listed by McInnis FM are as follows: 1. There is no onus of proof upon an applicant for extension of time though an application has to be made. Special circumstances need not be shown, but the court will not grant the application unless positively satisfied it is proper to do so. The 'prescribed period' of 28 days is not to be ignored ( Ralkon v Aboriginal Development Commission (1982) 43 ALR 535 at 550). 2. It is a prima facie rule that the proceedings commenced outside the prescribed period will not be entertained ( Lucic v Nolan (1982) 45 ALR 411 at 416). It is not a precondition for success in an application for extension of time that an acceptable explanation for delay must be given. It is to be expected that such an explanation will normally be given as a relevant matter to be considered, even though there is no rule that such an explanation is an essential precondition ( Comcare v A'Hearn (1993) 45 FCR 441 and Dix v Client Compensation Tribunal (1993) 1 VR 297 at 302). 3. Action taken by the applicant other than by making an application to the court is relevant in assessing the adequacy of the explanation for the delay. It is relevant to consider whether the applicant has rested on his rights and whether the respondent was entitled to regard the claim as being finalised (see Doyle v Chief of Staff (1982) 42 ALR 283 at 287). 4. Any prejudice to the respondent, including any prejudice in defending the proceeding occasioned by the delay, is a material factor militating against the grant of an extension (see Doyle at 287). 5. The mere absence of prejudice is not enough to justify the grant of an extension (see Lucic at 416). 6. The merits of the substantial application are properly to be taken into account in considering whether an extension of time should be granted (see Lucic at 417). 7. Considerations of fairness as between the applicant and other persons otherwise in a like position are relevant to the manner of exercise of the court's discretion (see Wedesweiller v Cole (1983) 47 ALR 528)."

One of its products was a koala soft toy, which had a label attached to it with the words ""Aussie Born"" on one side, and the words ""Made in Australia"" on the other side, with smaller words ""With Some Imported Components"" beneath those words. The soft toys were designed in Australia, the components were manufactured in China, except for about 30% of the filling, and all the components were then imported into Australia, for assembly within Australia. The primary judge declared the labels were in breach of ss 52 and 53(eb) of the TP Act and made an order under s 80 of the TP Act. The Full Court dismissed an appeal from those orders and held that the labels were misleading and deceptive, although that the toys could fairly be described as having been designed and finished in Australia. Sackville J observed at 500: While it should not be assumed that purchasers are ""extraordinarily stupid"" ... neither should it be assumed that purchasers of products such as toy koalas will be scrupulous to analyse the nuances of the language the trader has chosen to use on labels attached to the merchandise ... The meaning conveyed by the labels will be assessed by construing the language employed, but will take account of such factors as the prominence given to particular slogans or phrases, the nature of the product itself and the expectations and likely understanding of consumers."

Case21978,cited,"Rabin v Mendoza &amp; Co [1954] 1 All ER 247, [1954] 1 WLR 271","the present case, Allphones put in train a formal dispute resolution process which involved negotiations with its disaffected franchisees and, if necessary, a formal mediation. In order to make that process worthwhile, at the time when the process commenced (viz on 29 August 2008), Allphones promised that it would provide relevant financial information to those parties with whom it was in dispute in order to facilitate those negotiations and that mediation. It was quite prepared to obtain and to provide to its franchisees an investigating accountant's report in respect of all of the critical matters in dispute. This was contemplated in the Notice of Dispute itself which, of course, was created and served approximately five or six weeks before the undertakings were given to the Court on 9 October 2008. A fair appreciation of the relevant events is that the two BDO reports were always intended to be part of the dispute resolution process and that Allphones had probably always intended to use them in support of contentions which it would make in the various Statements of Position served by it as to the quantum of the levies, charges, fines, bonuses, rebates and other payments in dispute. At common law, documents produced for the purposes of such negotiations attracted without prejudice privilege (see Rabin v Mendoza &amp; Co [1954] 1 All ER 247, [1954] 1 WLR 271 ; and Bailey v Beagle Management Pty Limited [2001] FCA 185 at [14] [16])."
Case12707,referred to,Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky [1992] 39 FCR 31,"The applicant relied upon the judgment of the Full Court in Demagogue Pty Ltd v Ramensky (1992) 39 FCR 31 ('Demagogue') to support the proposition that 'loss or damage' did not have to be loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded. That may well be correct but Demagogue may be distinguished on the basis that it concerned misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Trade Practices Act '), in the form of non-disclosure by a vendor of unusual features relating to access to land located at Noosa Heads in the State of Queensland, which the purchasers, who sought relief under s 87(1) and/or (1A) of the Trade Practices Act , acquired by entering into a contract which they would never have entered into had they been aware of the true position with regard to access to the site. The trial judge had clearly found a causal link between the misleading and deceptive conduct and the purchasers' entry into the contract (see per Black CJ at 33 and per Gummow J at 42). 112 Each of Black CJ, Gummow J and Cooper J found that the expression 'loss or damage' where used in s 87 of the Trade Practices Act , and which corresponded in many respects with s 412(2) of the Act in the present case, could include being saddled with an agreement which had been induced by misleading or deceptive conduct. At 33 Black CJ said: '... I consider it to be clear that the loss or damage contemplated by s 87(1A) is not limited to loss or damage in the s 82 [monetary damages] sense but was intended to include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract unconscionably induced. ... In my view, the loss or damage for the purposes of both ss 87(1) and 87(1A) will include the detriment suffered by being bound to a contract induced by misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52. Proof of loss or damage of the sort that would be an ""amount of ... loss or damage"" for the purpose of s 82 is not a prerequisite for the grant of relief under either subsection.' 113 Gummow J, in his leading judgment, said at 42-43: 'The phrase ""loss or damage"" appears in s 82 and in various subsections of s 87, particularly subss (1) and (1A). In my view, on this appeal nothing turns upon the circumstance that in a given case subs (1) may be attracted only by reason of the making of an application under s 82 to recover the amount of the loss or damage suffered by conduct in contravention in (sic) a provision of Pt IV or V. Section 82 is concerned with the recovery of ""the amount of the loss or damage"" suffered by conduct in contravention of the Act. Section 87(1) requires that the court consider that its order will compensate ""in whole or in part"" for the loss or damage or will prevent or reduce the loss or damage. Section 87(1A) requires that the orders concerned will compensate in whole or in part for the loss or damage suffered ""or likely to be suffered"", or will ""prevent or reduce the loss or damage suffered, or likely to be suffered ..."". Thus, whilst s 82 is concerned with the recovery of an amount representing the loss or damage, s 87 is concerned with compensation, whether in whole or in part, for loss or damage and with the reduction of loss or damage, and with the prevention of loss or damage which is likely to be suffered. In the phrase ""likely to be suffered"", the word ""likely"" speaks of a ""real chance or possibility"": Western Australia v Wardley Australia Ltd (1991) 30 FCR 245 at 261. One significant distinction between ss 82 and 87 is the quia timet operation of s 87. On the appeal to the High Court in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia [1992] HCA 55 ; (1992) 175 CLR 514 at 527 [Mason CJ, Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ said] : ""The Act draws a clear distinction in Pt VI between loss or damage which may be recovered under s 82 and the likelihood of loss or damage which may be prevented, or, if not prevented, reduced by one of the remedies under s 87."" Deane J said (at 850) that the statute in s 87 expressly distinguishes between the actual suffering of loss or damage and the likelihood (or contingency) that loss or damage will be suffered in the future. This emphasises that the phrase ""the loss or damage"", at least in s 87, may be concerned with more than pecuniary recovery as understood in the law of damages in tort; tort law postulates the commission, already accomplished, of a wrong: Leeds Industrial Co-operative Society Ltd v Slack [1924] AC 851 at 859, 868-869. Further, unlike the position at general law with the administration of the equitable remedy of rescission of contracts, orders under s 87 may be made not only against parties to the contract but also against third parties, being persons involved (within the meaning of s 75B) in the contravention as a result of which the plaintiff entered into the contract: Lezam Pty Ltd v Seabridge Australia Pty Ltd ... at 304; Munchies Management Pty Ltd v Belperio ... at 714. The respondents complain that they entered into a contract as the result of reliance upon conduct which contravened s 52. Why should they not be described as having suffered loss or damage, within the meaning of s 87, by that very reliance and entry into legal relations from which they otherwise would have abstained? If that contract be declared void ab initio as provided for in s 87(2)(a), will that not reduce this loss or damage?' 114 Cooper J also proceeded in Demagogue to expound upon the meaning of the phrase 'loss or damage'. At 44, Gummow J expressed his agreement with what Cooper J said in that regard. Cooper J's observations were recorded at 46-48 as follows: 'Section 87 provides both the source of the court's power to provide a remedy and the remedy itself. It is therefore important to distinguish clearly between the need to establish the factual circumstances necessary to enliven the power of the court to grant relief and the circumstances which are relevant to the nature of the relief which it is appropriate to grant. The circumstance in s 87(1) which empowers the court to grant relief is a finding that a party ""has suffered or is likely to suffer loss or damage by the conduct of another person"". That is a question of fact. The words ""loss or damage"" where they appear in s 87(1) are to be construed by the application of the ordinary canons of statutory construction. This requires giving the words their ordinary meaning in the context in which they appear. The ordinary meaning of loss is ""detriment or disadvantage resulting from deprivation or change of conditions"" ( Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed (Revised), 1990) at 1241). ""Damage"" is defined as ""1. Loss or detriment caused by hurt or injury affecting estate, condition or circumstances (Arch) 2. Injury, harm"". ( Shorter Oxford English Dictionary at 485). There are two matters within the context of s 87(1) which colour the meaning of the phrase in the section. The first is that the loss or damage has been or is likely to be caused by conduct in contravention of the Act. The second is that any order made is to compensate for the loss or damage. However, the compensation is not limited to the payment of a money sum or damages as an examination of s 87(2) discloses. Nor is there anything in s 87(2) which would limit the loss or damage suffered or likely to be suffered to pecuniary loss or damage. In particular, s 87(2)(a) (declaring a contract or collateral agreement to be void) and s 87(2)(ba) (refusing to enforce any or all provisions of a contract) take as their point of focus the denial of the benefit of a contract to a person whose proscribed conduct has caused loss or damage to the other party. Such an order has the consequential effect of releasing the innocent party from the obligations imposed by the contract. In the context of providing compensation it is the obligations imposed by such a contract which is the loss or damage which the order seeks to redress. In my opinion ""loss or damage"" in s 87(1) means no more than the disadvantage which is suffered by a person as the result of the act or default of another ( Halsbury's Laws of England (4th ed), Vol 12, par 1102) in the circumstances provided for in the section. The phrase ""loss or damage"" in s 87(1) does not involve any concept of quantum or assessment of damages: see Barneys Blu-Crete Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union (1979) 43 FLR 463 at 473 where Northrop J expressed a similar view as to the use of the same phrase in s 45D(1)(a) of the Act. This is to be contrasted with the context of the phrase in s 82 where it is ""the amount of the loss or damage"" which is recoverable by action. For the purpose of s 82 it is the quantum or assessment of the loss or damage suffered in monetary terms which must be demonstrated. The rules as to the assessment of damages or the measure of damages in an action for deceit are relevant to the question of loss or damage under s 82. However those rules are not relevant to the meaning of the phrase in s 87(1). The distinction between ""loss or damage"" and ""the amount of the loss or damage"" is reflected in the terms of section 4K of the Act. The section provides: ""In this Act (a) a reference to loss or damage, other than a reference to the amount of any loss or damage, includes a reference to injury; and (b) a reference to the amount of any loss or damage includes a reference to damages in respect of an injury."" There are practical reasons why this should be so. The prima facie rule that the measure of damage in deceit is the difference between the value of the property and the price paid is inappropriate where the contract is not completed: Myers v Transpacific Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1986] ATPR 47,421 at 47,424. Where the contract remains unrescinded the costs associated with the conveyance of the property are costs arising out of the contract and of performing the obligations imposed thereby. Until the contract is rescinded such costs and expenses do not take on the character of costs and expenses thrown away and as such recoverable loss and damage under the general law. The court is not restricted in granting a remedy under s 87 by the limitations under the general law of a party's right to rescind for breach of contract or misrepresentation ( Henjo Investments Pty Ltd v Collins Marrickville Pty Ltd (1988) 79 ALR 83 at 102, 109). Likewise the limitations under the general law as to the assessment of damages and the measure of damage ought not be imported into a definition of ""loss or damage"" in s 87 to limit the category of actionable loss or damage. To adopt a definition of ""loss or damage"" for the purpose of s 87(1) which includes the disadvantage of incurring contractual obligations that would not have been incurred but for the conduct complained of does not mean that the granting of a proper discretionary remedy necessarily leads to the setting aside of such a contract or to a refusal to enforce it according to its terms. That result will always depend upon the particular circumstances which exist when the occasion calls for an exercise of the powers under s 87 of the Act. ...' 115 The problem for the applicant and Ms Stringer in particular, in the present case, is that there is simply no evidence of any loss or damage for which monetary damages could be awarded, if otherwise appropriate and available, in her favour or in favour of any of Karellas' other employees. Nor is there any evidence that the approval, making and/or coming into operation of the 2007 Agreement resulted from the contravention by Karellas of s 341(1) of the Act. 116 Section 412(2) of the Act confines the Court's power to declare a workplace agreement void to those cases where the relevant loss or damage to be remedied, prevented or reduced is loss or damage 'resulting from' the relevant contravention. In order to establish a causal link between the contravention of s 341(1) of the Act and Karellas employees becoming saddled with the 2007 Agreement in this case, evidence would be required from employees of Karellas who voted to approve the agreement indicating that had it not been for one or other of the misrepresentations contained in the four page document or the three page document put around by Karellas, they would not have voted as they did. 117 In the absence of any evidence on the issue, the Court may not make an order declaring the 2007 Agreement void. It is unnecessary, in the circumstances, to address the proper exercise of the Court's discretion to grant relief under s 409(a) of the Act were it otherwise able to do so. 118 In the foregoing circumstances, there should be a declaration that the employee collective agreement styled 'Karellas Investments Pty Ltd Employee Collective Agreement 2007' was not approved in accordance with s 340(2) of the Act. Otherwise, the Amended Application filed in Court on 23 May 2007 should be dismissed. 119 Given the terms of s 824 of the Act, there should be no order as to costs.

Case10221,cited,Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89,"the purposes of a passing off action, it should also be noted at the outset that the comparison involved is different to the comparison undertaken for the purposes of resolving whether the use of a mark is "" deceptively similar "" for the purposes of s 120 of the Trade Marks Act : Wingate Marketing Pty Ltd v Levi Strauss &amp; Co (1994) 49 FCR 89. Gummow J there observed at 128: Where the comparison of the marks is necessary to determine whether that of the defendant is deceptively similar to the registered mark of the plaintiff, who sues for infringement, the primary comparison must be between the registered mark on the one hand and the mark as used by the defendant on the other. The comparison differs from that in a passing off action where the plaintiff points to the goodwill built up around the mark by reason of prior use and then points to the conduct of the defendant as leading to deception (or perhaps merely confusion) and consequent damage to that goodwill of the plaintiff. No relief is sought as against the First or Second Respondents. Liability is, however, sought to be established as against the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents. That liability is said by the Applicants to arise by reason of either: s 75B of the Trade Practices Act , in the event that there is a contravention of ss 52 or 53 of that Act; or the liability ascribed to directors and others for corporate wrongdoing, in the case of an infringement of the trade mark or passing off. The liability of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Respondents arose on the Applicants' case in respect to conduct occurring as between May 2006 and January 2008."

Case21718,cited,Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629,"The preference claim is qualified by the elucidator. However, there can be no doubt that Unilever intended to communicate superiority. This is not a case of ""mere puffery"" ( Gillette Australia Pty Ltd v Energizer Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 193 ALR 629 at [44]). That asserted superiority was in terms of performance attributes, rather than other attributes such as fragrance. While Mr Kibble may have intended the testing to be of ' the performance of the product and its sensory appeal (skin feel and fragrance)' (emphasis added), the advertisement made no reference to fragrance and little or no reference to sensory, in contrast to tanning performance, appeal. 40 It follows that I accept Johnson's submission that the message communicated by the commercial is that 7 out of 10 users of Holiday Skin preferred Summer Glow to Holiday Skin for its tanning attributes. The first representation was made in the television advertisement. 41 The print advertisement states that Summer Glow ' combines rich body lotion with a hint of self tanning agents ' and includes in its list of the product's attributes ' everyday body moisturiser ' and ' gradually builds a beautiful light tan '. This places greater emphasis than does the television advertisement on the moisturising capacity of the product. 76 Comparative advertising does not create any presumption with respect to a breach of the Act ( Energizer at [20]). However, as Heerey J pointed out in Energizer , the more actual comparison is used, the more potential there is for error and half-truth (at [20]). The factual assertions must be ' not untrue, or misleading half-truths ' (at [22]). Lindgren J discussed at [34] the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement to be making reference. In that case, it was conceded that, if the comparator to which the consumer would understand the advertisement was referring was all Energizer batteries rather than the one particular battery the subject of comparison, the advertisement was misleading or deceptive. 77 Unilever's reliance on the failure by Johnson to establish that a different preference would have been expressed had all four variants been tested by the study is ill-founded. The fact is that the study simply did not include the two variants of Holiday Skin or compare them to both variants of Summer Glow. The reasonable consumer would have understood, in the absence of qualification, that the user preference was found to exist across all variants, or at the least, to a comparison of each comparable variant, when no such preference had been expressed in the ""use test""."
Case12450,cited,Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1980] HCA 44 ; (1980) 147 CLR 39,"to the question posed in [56(b)] above (the cause of action based upon the breach of the equitable duty of confidence), the following matters are relevant: (a) The classic definition of the equitable duty of confidence is found in Lord Ashburton v Pape [1913] 2 Ch 469 at 475. At that part of his reasons, Swinfen Eady LJ said: The principle upon which the Court of Chancery has acted for many years has been to restrain the publication of confidential information improperly or surreptitiously obtained or of information imparted in confidence which ought not to be divulged. Injunctions have been granted to give effectual relief, that is not only to restrain the disclosure of confidential information, but to prevent copies being made of any record of that information, and, if copies have already been made, to restrain them from being further copied, and to restrain persons into whose possession that confidential information has come from themselves in turn divulging or propagating it. These observations were cited with evident approval by Mason J in Commonwealth v John Fairfax &amp; Sons Ltd [1980] HCA 44 ; (1980) 147 CLR 39 at 50; (b) In the present case, the information was not improperly or surreptitiously obtained. It is contended that it was imparted in confidence in circumstances where it ought not to be divulged; (c) The question of whether an equitable duty arises in the present case is not straightforward. The relevant information was contained in documents which were produced pursuant to compulsory powers invoked by the ACCC and in circumstances where it is at least arguable that the only source of any duty of confidence is s 155AAA itself. Although the use of documents and information obtained compulsorily in this way is constrained by s 155AAA and perhaps may be constrained by other general law principles, it is difficult to see how a party in the position of Allphones could sensibly expect that the information would be kept confidential and not disclosed even for legitimate purposes associated with the due performance by the ACCC of its statutory functions. It may be thought that this is particularly so in circumstances where Allphones made no express claim for confidentiality when the documents were produced. In Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Limited [2008] FCA 88 ; (2008) 246 ALR 137 , [2008] ATPR 42-218 , Gordon J, in the context of considering claims that documents ought not to be disclosed on public interest immunity grounds, said (at [30]): The theoretical merit of the ACCC's confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties. As such, the ACCC's claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance. And without such a reasonable expectation, the ACCC's contention that non-disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand. and (d) The definition of protected information seems to me to contemplate a dichotomy between information that is given (voluntarily) in confidence to the ACCC, on the one hand, and information that was obtained by the ACCC (compulsorily) pursuant to a s 155 Notice, on the other hand. In the latter case, the section seems to contemplate that there is no room for any equitable duty of confidence to arise."

The usual order for costs is that costs follow the event and are paid on a party/party basis unless there are special circumstances which warrant the making of some other order. However, it has long been established that the Court may award costs on a solicitor/client or indemnity basis where the particular circumstances of the case warrant the Court departing from the usual order of party/party costs: Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225. In Colgate-Palmolive Company v Cussons Pty Limited (supra), Sheppard J set out some of the circumstances which he considered had been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion to make an order for payment of costs not on the usual basis of party/party costs but on the basis of indemnity costs. Those circumstances included ""an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise""."
Case18786,cited,Anderson v Commonwealth of Australia [1932] HCA 2 ; (1932) 47 CLR 50,"Defining private rights for this purpose is a distinct challenge (note Heydon JD ""Injunctions and Declarations"" in Stein LA (ed) Locus Standi (Law Book Company, 1979) at 38-39).

The distinction between rights which are ""private rights"" enabling commencement of proceedings by way, for example, of declaratory and injunctive relief, and ""public rights"" the enforcement of which lay at the feet of the Attorney-General, has however blurred over time to permit individuals to bring proceedings where the individual suffers special damage peculiar to himself or herself from the interference with the public right: Boyce [1903] 1 Ch at 114.

Case21528,considered,Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd [1979] 1 WLR 305,"The Commissioner sought to derive support for his contention from Hygienic Lily Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1987) 13 FCR 396. The question there was whether waxed paper cups used by McDonald's Restaurants were ""goods ... of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes"". Gummow J at 399 said: ""the setting in which the phrase 'goods of a kind' appears suggests it is directed not to the use for which the particular goods in question were designed or manufactured, nor to the purpose to which it is intended these particular goods shall be put, but rather to the nature, quality and adaptation of goods in the class or genus in question. Thus, goods are 'of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes' if they are to be recognised as members of a class or genus which commonly or regularly (albeit not necessarily exclusively or principally) is used for household purposes; cf Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd (1979) 1 WLR 305, at 312-313, 315, 316-317."" At 400 his Honour pointed out that other items in the Schedule there in question directed attention not to goods identified by the purposes for which goods of that kind are ordinarily used, but to the goods in question themselves or to the identity or character of a particular user. He concluded that the cups were of a kind ordinarily used for household purposes because they were ""members of a class or genus (paper cups) which commonly or regularly (albeit not necessarily exclusively or principally) was used for household purposes (viz the carrying of beverages and the consumption thereof)"". 19 In Air International Hill J, dissenting, quoted with approval the decision of the Court of Appeal in Customs and Excise Commissioners v Mechanical Services (Trailer Engineers) Ltd [1979] 1 WLR 305, to which Gummow J had referred in Hygienic Lily . The question in the English case was whether couplings and winches were to be classified for value added tax purposes as ""Goods of a kind suitable for use as parts of goods within item 1 or item 5"". Hill J said at [28]: ""Brown LJ held that the words 'goods of a kind' referred to some class or category or genus of goods which had characteristics in common. That holding is generally consistent with the Australian sales tax cases referred to in Clean Investments."" Hill J then quoted with approval this passage from Megaw LJ's judgment (at 316-317): ""It is not 'the goods' the particular articles, here the couplings and the winch which have to be suitable for use as parts. It is the kind of goods to which these particular articles belong, their genus, which has to be thus suitable. The addition of 'of a kind', would be meaningless if goods which are themselves suitable are necessarily also goods of a kind which is suitable. The question is, first, what is the relevant 'kind of goods' of which they are members; and, secondly, is that kind of goods generically, suitable for use as parts of the goods comprised in items 1 and 5 of Group 3."""

Case5449,referred to,M55 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 131,"Two other matters were raised by counsel for the respondent.

In my view, having looked at the reasons for judgment in that case, I am not persuaded that they vary the position in any way from the position taken in NAZY v MIMIA or in M55 v MIMIA . Accordingly, I do not consider that there is any basis for a contention that there has been a breach of s 424A."
Case13709,referred to,Seven Network Ltd and Anor v News Ltd and Ors (No 2) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 148 FCR 1,"Seven Network Ltd and Anor v News Ltd and Ors (No 2) [2005] FCA 1394 ; (2005) 148 FCR 1 Sackville J said at [27]: '... it seems to me that unless the interests of justice require otherwise, this Court would ordinarily take the view that a non-party should have access to all non-confidential documents and other material admitted into evidence. I say 'ordinarily' because the circumstances of each case will vary and the exercise of the discretion under O 46, r 6 of the Rules will have to take into account the particular circumstances of the case. I agree ... that a convenient touchstone for determining the question of access by non-parties is whether the documents or other material have been admitted into evidence. In general, the application of this principle will serve the interests of open justice. In particular, access to the documentary evidence can be expected to be helpful to a person seeking to understand or explain the proceedings, or to evaluate the Court's determination of the issues arising in the proceedings ...' The above passage was approved by French J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission, in the matter of Richstar Enterprises Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (No 2) [2006] FCA 407 at [18] . 0 I agree with Rares J in Llewellyn that the approach adopted in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in which different rules apply, is different from the approach adopted by the rules of this Court: see at [21] and [22] of his Honour's judgment. Pursuant to O 46 r 6(1) of the Federal Court Rules , a non-party will generally be entitled to access the pleadings. Accordingly I do not consider the comments of Santow J in eisa Ltd v Brady and Ors [2000] NSWSC 929 at [20] are applicable to this Court in so far as they apply to pleadings. However, in respect of affidavit material which has not been read in Court, the comments of Santow J in respect of affidavits accord with the principle outlined by Sackville J in Macquarie Radio and Seven Network ."
Case9677,discussed,Derby &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon (Nos. 3 and 4) [1990] 1 Ch 65,"The contention of the applicant in the present case that the Court could debar the respondents from defending the proceeding, and strike out their defences, is based on a comment of Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in Derby &amp; Co Ltd v Weldon (Nos. 3 and 4) [1990] 1 Ch 65 at 81. In that case, the English Court of Appeal was considering whether it was appropriate for a court to grant a Mareva -type injunction in respect of assets beyond the jurisdiction of the court. Relevant to that question was the question whether such an injunction could be enforced in any event. The Master of the Rolls said: 'in the context of the grant of the Mareva injunction, I think that a sufficient sanction exists in the fact that, in the event of disobedience, the court could bar the defendant's right to defend. This is not a consequence which it could contemplate lightly as it would become a fugitive from a final judgment given against it without its explanations having been heard and which might well be enforced against it by other courts.' Neill LJ at 87 and Butler-Sloss LJ at 96 expressed agreement with the judgment of the Master of the Rolls. Each went on to deal with the issues in the case, with Neill LJ at 95 expressing specific agreement with what the Master of the Rolls had said about enforceability. Butler-Sloss LJ did not comment specifically on that issue. It is unnecessary in the present case to debate the question whether barring the right to defend a proceeding falls within the range of penalties the Court could impose for contempt of court. Order 35A of the Federal Court Rules contains specific provisions about the powers of the Court in the event of default of a party in complying with an order. Order 35A r 2(2)(d) provides that a respondent is in default by failing to comply with an order of the Court in a proceeding. Order 35A r 3(2)(c) provides that, if a respondent is in default, the Court may: 'if the proceeding was commenced by an application supported by a statement of claim or the Court has ordered that the proceeding continue on pleadings -- give judgment against the respondent for the relief that: (i) the applicant appears entitled to on the statement of claim; and (ii) the Court is satisfied it has power to grant'. Order 35A r 3(2)(d) also provides that, if a respondent is in default, the Court may give judgment or make any other order against the respondent. Order 35A r 4 specifically provides that O 35A does not limit the power of the Court to punish for contempt. It must be the case, however, that, if the Court exercises its power to give judgment against a respondent, on the ground that the respondent has failed to comply with an order of the Court, and the giving of judgment has significant consequences for the respondent, those consequences could be taken into account as factors mitigating the exercise of the Court's powers to punish for contempt. 52 The contempt in this case is a serious one. It involved a significant sum of money, $73 987.57. As I have said, Ms Bell was well aware that an injunction had been granted, restricting her freedom of action in relation to the sale of the Mariners Place property, and her freedom of action to deal with the proceeds of sale if a sale were effected. She chose not to have regard to the terms of that order. She preferred to satisfy her obligations, or perceived obligations, and to spend the money for her own purposes, instead of complying with the injunction. In short, she preferred her own interests, and even her own whims, to her duty to comply with the injunction. The effect of the contempt on the administration of justice is also of major significance. If Ms Bell had complied with the injunction, the applicant would have been secure in the knowledge that he could bring the proceeding to its conclusion and, if he were to be successful, there would be a substantial asset available to satisfy the judgment and to augment the estate of the bankrupt, for the benefit of the bankrupt's creditors. There is now a powerful disincentive to the applicant in proceeding to a conclusion, because the execution of any judgment is much less likely to prove fruitful. This consequence can be ameliorated to some extent by exercising the power to give judgment summarily against Ms Bell, thereby saving the applicant from the need to expend further costs in the proceeding, but it still renders the proceeding largely fruitless for the applicant if, as appears to be the case, Ms Bell has no means of satisfying a judgment. The effect of the contempt, therefore, is to tilt the balance in the litigation heavily against the applicant. 53 There can be little doubt that a contempt of this magnitude, coupled with the degree of culpability of Ms Bell (amounting to wilful blindness as to the terms of the order, as I have said, and to preferring to satisfy her own needs and desires) would warrant a significant term of imprisonment. Only if there are powerful mitigating factors would it be appropriate to consider a course other than imprisonment as a minimum step. It is therefore necessary to turn to the mitigating factors. 54 Ms Bell claims that she did not understand the nature of the order and therefore that she did not intend to commit a breach of it or to demonstrate any disrespect for the Court. She has expressed her contrition for her failure to comply, and has apologised to the Court. I accept that she did not in fact understand the terms of the order, although they had been explained to her by her then counsel, and she was in possession of a copy of the order. Although I do not consider that the order is a particularly complex one, I can accept that legal terminology and drafting techniques can make an order less than wholly comprehensible to some people. 55 The fact is, however, as I have found, that Ms Bell did not pay any heed to the order at all. She did not take the trouble to read it in the context of the conduct of the auction of the Mariners Place property, or in the context of her disposal of the proceeds of sale. She did not provide the agent responsible for the sale, or the auctioneer, with the copy of the order that she had, either for the purpose of guiding their conduct, or for the purpose of seeking guidance from them as to her own. She did not seek advice from Kelly &amp; Chapman, who were then acting for her in the principal proceeding. She simply decided not to have regard to the order. Even when her contravention of it was pointed out to her, she took no immediate steps to remedy the contravention. Her initial explanation, in her affidavit of 21 September 2006, was anything but frank as to what had happened to the proceeds. It was necessary for me to make a further order on 25 September 2006, requiring Ms Bell to make an affidavit, explaining specifically the manner in which the sum of $73 987.57 had been expended. Even then, in her affidavit of 9 October 2006, she was vague about a number of the payments she had made. Both of these affidavits were prepared by her without legal assistance, which is a partial explanation for their inadequacy. Even when she swore her affidavit of 18 December 2006, prepared with the assistance of her pro bono lawyers, no further detail was provided. Only in her oral evidence, and under cross-examination, was further detail about the payments obtained. Her expression of contrition and her formal apology to the Court only came about after she had received the advice of her counsel as to the seriousness of her position."

That is not to say that the principle articulated in Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 has not been extended beyond the banker/customer/surety relationship, however circumstances in which the Dobbs [1935] HCA 49 ; (1935) 53 CLR 643 principle is applicable are primarily confined to those involving the issue of a certificate as to the existence of a fact pursuant to legislation, or certain types of agreement, for example:"

I found that Mr Siminton was a person who had carried on and was proposing to carry on the business of banking in Australia and that such conduct constituted or would constitute a contravention of s 7 of the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) (""the Act ""). I also found that Mr Siminton had engaged in conduct which contravened s 66 of the Act . I foreshadowed making injunctive orders to restrain Mr Siminton from engaging in further contraventions of the Act and orders appointing a receiver to identify the persons who had made deposits in the ""bank"" established by Mr Siminton, to get in the funds which were the subject of an order, made by Gray J on 10 January 2006, and to provide for an orderly and equitable distribution of those funds to depositors.

Case6873,cited,Challenger Life Limited [2004] FCA 618,"Court has said that the granting of a dispensation under s 17C(5) (or its analogue in the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth), s 191(5)) is a ""matter of considerable importance and should not be regarded as a matter of course"": Munich Reinsurance Company of Australasia Limited [2004] FCA 1391 at [4] , per Tamberlin J. See also Challenger Life Limited [2004] FCA 618 ( Challenger Life Limited ) at [2]-[3], per Gyles J. This is because, as Sackville J stated in The Application of Commonwealth Life Ltd &amp; Anor [2003] FCA 501 ( Commonwealth Life Ltd ) at [8]: Clearly enough, the policy underlying the statutory requirement ... is to give every affected policyholder a summary of the scheme and, an opportunity, if he or she so desires, to make submissions to the Court in respect of any application for confirmation of the scheme. A right to be heard in relation to a proposed scheme may be of little value if a person does not know of the proposal. The fact that additional steps will be taken to draw the scheme to the attention of the affected policyholders (see [33]-[36] above) has been held to be a factor favouring the granting of a dispensation under s 17C(5) (or the equivalent provision of the Life Insurance Act 1995 ) in several cases, including GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd at [18], Commonwealth Life Ltd at [6] and [10], Challenger Life Limited at [5], and Calliden Group Limited at [62]. Fifth, APRA does not oppose the making of the order. The fact that APRA, which is charged with the responsibility of protecting the interests of policyholders, has raised no objection has been said to be a matter in favour of a dispensation: see, eg Commonwealth Life Ltd at [6] and [10], Challenger Life Limited at [5]; Calliden Group Limited at [62]."
Case24612,cited,Registrar of Aboriginal Corporation v Murnkurni Women's Aboriginal Corporation (1995) 58 FCR 125,"J's decision was considered by Nicholson J in Registrar of Aboriginal Corporation v Murnkurni Women's Aboriginal Corporation (1995) 58 FCR 125 at 127-128. His Honour's reasons do not shed much light on the reason behind the respondent's failure to appear in that case, though it is apparent that the applicant had obtained an order for substituted service which was, as was accepted by the respondent in that case, properly effected. His Honour went on to say: It may not be that the dicta of Hodgson J in Kizkot and the principles relied upon for Murnkurni are necessarily in conflict. All that Hodgson J required was evidence which ""indicates"" solvency. He did not say that solvency was to be established as a fact. Certainly he must have accepted there should be evidence which indicates solvency in the sense of showing it to be arguable that the company was solvent. In my opinion the effect of the authorities is to require this Court to consider whether there is an arguable defence which in turn requires the Court to consider whether solvency is arguable. ... For the reasons given I consider that both the solvency and other aspects are arguable and that, accordingly, the application to set aside the order pursuant to FCR O 35, r 7(2)(a) should be granted."
Case18834,cited,Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1,"In contrast, in the case before me the HREOC Act and the DD Act (including the Disability Standards formulated pursuant to s 31) provide a scheme which allows ""a person aggrieved"" by alleged unlawful discrimination - including, as I have already noted, conduct deemed unlawful by s 32 DD Act - to lodge a complaint with HREOC (s 46P HREOC Act); and in the event that the complaint is terminated, a person affected by the termination to make application to the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court (s 46PO HREOC Act). Significantly, the HREOC Act also creates a specific structure sanctioning applications to the Court for remedies where the Court is satisfied that there has been unlawful discrimination, including payment of damages by the respondent, employment or re-employment an applicant, an order declaring that the respondent has committed unlawful discrimination and directing the respondent not to repeat or continue such unlawful discrimination as is sought in this case (s 46PO(4) HREOC Act). Indeed the point of the statutory scheme as constituted in this case by the HREOC Act and the DD Act is to make laws with respect to discriminatory conduct, and to allow those who are aggrieved by discriminatory conduct, personal rights to seek redress in respect of such conduct. To adopt the language of the majority of the High Court in Re East, ex parte Nguyen 196 CLR at 365, repeated in Western Australia v Ward [2002] HCA 28 ; (2002) 213 CLR 1 at 96, The elaborate and special scheme...was plainly intended by the Parliament to provide the means by which a person aggrieved by a contravention ... might obtain a remedy, and thus was regarded by Parliament as fulfilling Australia's treaty obligations, bearing always in mind the legal structure and system which formed the context in which the [legislation] was to operate. (That those comments were in respect of the legislation as it stood prior to amendments, and the removal of provisions from the HREOC Act into the DD Act and other statutes, does not in any way minimise their relevance. As observed, in my view correctly, by Nicholson J in Bropho v State of Western Australia [2004] FCA 1209 at [26] - [29] and [51]-[52], they are equally applicable to the scheme as it presently exists.)"

Case18833,cited,Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth [1943] HCA 19 ; (1943) 67 CLR 335,"Tenth, to the extent that incorporated associations are bodies corporate which may sue or be sued in their own name, in assessing the interests of a body corporate the interests of its members are arguably irrelevant. So in Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v The Commonwealth [1943] HCA 19 ; (1943) 67 CLR 335 at 343 Starke J, without needing to decide the point, observed that an infringement of the rights of members of an incorporated body does of itself mean that the rights of the incorporated body are infringed, or that the incorporated body has standing to maintain an action (cf Lockhart J in Right to Life 56 FCR at 253 and Nicholson J in Defence Coalition against RCD Inc v Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (1997) 74 FCR 142). This may be distinguished from the position concerning unincorporated associations. A useful illustration of this point in this context is Scully 79 FCR 537, where an unincorporated association commenced proceedings under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (in its then form), Wilcox J said: I agree with Commissioner Nettlefold that, as Executive Council for Australian Jewry is not a ""person"" in the eyes of the law, it is incapable of being a 'person aggrieved' within the meaning of s 22(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act . Therefore it is not itself a competent complainant. However, this does not mean its complaint is a nullity. It is necessary to go behind the name and consider whether the juristic persons who constitute the unincorporated association are 'persons aggrieved' by the allegedly unlawful act. If they are, the complaint is competent in law, though not in name, as it was made by them. (at 548) 59 Second, there is substantial body of authority, to which I have already referred, that the interests of members of a body corporate do not equate with the interests of the body corporate: Victorian Chamber of Manufactures [1943] HCA 19 ; 67 CLR 335, Right to Life 56 FCR 50, Defence Coalition against RCD 74 FCR 142."
Case4098,followed,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69] - [71] McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said: '[69] The primary object of statutory construction is to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute (see Taylor v Public Service Board (NSW) [1976] HCA 36 ; (1976) 137 CLR 208 at 213 per Barwick CJ). The meaning of the provision must be determined ""by reference to the language of the instrument viewed as a whole"" ( Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 320, per Mason and Wilson JJ. See also South West Water Authority v Rumble's [1985] AC 609 at 617, per Lord Scarman, ""in the context of the legislation read as a whole"".). In Commissioner for Railways (NSW) v Agalianos ((1955) 92 CLR 39), Dixon CJ pointed out that ""the context, the general purpose and policy of a provision and its consistency and fairness are surer guides to its meaning than the logic with which it is constructed"". Thus, the process of construction must always begin by examining the context of the provision that is being construed ( Toronto Suburban Railway Co v Toronto Corporation [1915] AC 590 at 597; Minister for Lands (NSW) v Jeremias [1917] HCA 41 ; (1917) 23 CLR 322 at 332; K &amp; S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon &amp; Gotch Ltd [1985] HCA 48 ; (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 312, per Gibbs CJ; at 315, per Mason J; at 321, per Deane J). [70] A legislative instrument must be construed on the prima facie basis that its provisions are intended to give effect to harmonious goals ( Ross v The Queen [1979] HCA 29 ; (1979) 141 CLR 432 at 440, per Gibbs J). Where conflict appears to arise from the language of particular provisions, the conflict must be alleviated, so far as possible, by adjusting the meaning of the competing provisions to achieve that result which will best give effect to the purpose and language of those provisions while maintaining the unity of all the statutory provisions (see Australian Alliance Assurance Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Q) [1916] St R Qd 135 at 161, per Cooper CJ; Minister for Resources v Dover Fisheries Pty Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 565 at 574, per Gummow J). Reconciling conflicting provisions will often require the court ""to determine which is the leading provision and which the subordinate provision, and which must give way to the other"" ( Institute of Patent Agents v Lockwood [1894] AC 347 at 360, per Lord Herschell LC). Only by determining the hierarchy of the provisions will it be possible in many cases to give each provision the meaning which best gives effect to its purpose and language while maintaining the unity of the statutory scheme. [71] Furthermore, a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision ( The Commonwealth v Baume [1905] HCA 11 ; (1905) 2 CLR 405 at 414, per Griffith CJ; at 419, per O'Connor J; Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigraiton Local Government &amp; Ethnic Affairs [1992] HCA 64 ; (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 12-13,, per Mason CJ). In The Commonwealth v Baume ((1905) [1905] HCA 11 ; 2 CLR 405 at 414) Griffith CJ cited R v Berchet ((1688) 1 Show KB 106 [89 ER 480]) to support the proposition that it was ""a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause, sentence, or word shall prove superfluous, void, or insignificant, if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent"".' 46 Their Honours held (194 CLR at 384 [78]) that the duty of the court is to give the words of a statutory provision the meaning which the legislature is taken to have intended them to have. 47 In ascertaining what meaning the differing expressions in ss 290(2)(c) and 312(1)(e) were taken by the Parliament to have, it is important to bear in mind that each section is concerned with the impact which a conviction may have upon the Authority's performance of its functions in relation to the registration of a migration agent. First, s 290(2)(c) appears in the principal provision dealing with the function of registration, which is an annual event for every migration agent. Secondly, s 312(1)(e) is relevant to the ongoing function of the Authority under s 303 pursuant to which it has a discretion to cancel or suspend the registration of a migration agent or to caution him or her. The occasion for the exercise of that discretion arises if the Authority is satisfied, inter alia, that: '303 ... (f) the agent is not a person of integrity or is otherwise not a fit and proper person to give immigration assistance;' 48 The evident purpose of s 312 is to cast an obligation on the migration agent to notify the Authority of the events there enumerated so that the Authority can consider whether to revisit, pursuant to s 303 and the scheme of natural justice in Part 3 of Division 3 of the Act, the question of registration. Thus under s 312(1)(a) the migration agent's bankruptcy must be notified and s 303(e) makes bankruptcy a matter which enlivens the Authority's powers to cancel or suspend the migration agent's registration or to caution him or her. And, s 290(2)(g) requires the Authority to take into account an applicant's bankruptcy at any time in considering whether to register him or her as a migration agent. 49 Additionally, s 312(1) deals with events which occur after registration but which, had they occurred beforehand, would have been relevant for the Authority's consideration in deciding whether to register the person as a migration agent. However, it is important in construing these provisions to consider the fact that a contravention of s 312(1) is an offence of strict liability (s 312(2)), while s 290 creates no offence. 59 Gleeson CJ and Gummow J (200 CLR at 397 [25]) held that the term 'law of the Commonwealth' in s 80 of the Constitution refers to laws made under legislative powers of the Commonwealth. They held that an obligation or liability which had its source in the Constitution itself did not arise under a law of the Commonwealth. They continued (200 CLR at 397 [25]): 'The fact that there are laws made by the Parliament which are declaratory of the power implicit in Ch III of the Constitution or which make provision under s 51(xxxix) of the Constitution incidental to the exercise of that power does not bring the case within s 80. ' Hayne J agreed with Gleeson CJ and Gummow J (200 CLR at 428 [108], 429 [113])."

It is clear enough that s 31A is wider than the previous regime for summary judgment had become. Counsel cited a number of decisions that have discussed this provision the latest being Commonwealth Bank of Australia v ACN 000 247 601 Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1416 at [30] per Jacobson J and Hicks v Ruddock [2007] FCA 299 ; (2007) 156 FCR 574 at [13] per Tamberlin J.

Hence the significance of Sir Owen Dixon's observation as to the manner of construing the provisions now found in reg 87 of the Defence (Personnel) Regulations . This observation of Sir Owen Dixon has subsequently been cited with approval both in the High Court ( Marks v The Commonwealth [1964] HCA 45 ; (1964) 111 CLR 549 , at 573 per Windeyer J; Coutts v The Commonwealth [1985] HCA 40 ; (1984-1985) 157 CLR 91 , at 98 per Wilson J, Brennan J agreeing).and in this Court ( Bowthorpe v Minister for Defence (1986) 17 IR 192, at 195 per Neaves J; Bromet v Oddie ((2002) 78 ALD 320, at 331 per Finn J)."

While the reasoning process may advert to, and express views on, such issues, all will not necessarily constitute part of the reason for the Tribunal's decision. Tribunals, no less than courts, engage in their own species of dicta often enough for reasons related to haste and pressure in composition. When a Tribunal's reasons are to be evaluated for s 424A(1) purposes, the Court as a matter of judgment is required to isolate what were the integral parts of the reasons for the Tribunal's decision. That task, necessarily, is an interpretative one. In some instances the differentiation of the integral and the inessential may be by no means easy -- and made the more so by less than explicit indications in the reasons themselves as to what the Tribunal itself considered to be integral.' 24 Allsop J pointed out in SZEEU 230 ALR at [214] that the decision of the High Court in SAAP [2005] HCA 24 ; 215 ALR 162 requires some aspects of the analysis in VAF 206 ALR 471 to be rejected. However, I do not understand the authority of the above passage from VAF to have been generally undermined. Nonetheless, their Honours' reference to the 'integral' and the 'inessential' must be understood more strictly than may originally have been intended. The critical question is whether the information in question was a part (that is, any part) of the reason for affirming the decision ( SZEEU 230 ALR per Allsop J at [215])."

Thus, Sundberg J went on to conclude in Davis as follows: It was also submitted for Mrs Davis that because Professor Cade's report had been received in time for it to be used by the Commission in support of an application for review of the Board's decision by the AAT, it could not found an exercise of the Commission's power to review the Board's decision under s31(6)(a). A variation of this argument was that the Commission, having had a reasonable opportunity to put Professor Cade's report before the AAT, had not done so, and so was not able to use the report to found an exercise of power under s31(6). These assertions were not developed in argument, and in my view they have no substance. If material becomes available after the relevant decision is made, and it affects the payment of a pension, the power in s31(6)(a) is available to the Commission. It is simply irrelevant that it becomes available at a time when the Commission might seek a review by the AAT. The Commission may engage in conduct which disables it from taking a particular course, but in the absence of any such conduct, it can pursue whichever avenue it chooses. The second argument advanced has overtones of estoppel without any factual basis to support the estoppel. Further, in Repatriation Commission v Richardson [2001] FCA 1626 at [15] [18], [2001] FCA 1626 ; 115 FCR 220 Dowsett J concluded that it was open to the Commission pursuant to s 31(6) to have regard to material of which it was ignorant at the time the original decision was made to grant a pension."
Case4818,referred to,Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230,"There was no disagreement about the expression of the principles of construction. The debate lay in the different application of them, in particular in the subtle question of the correct perspective from, or prism through, which to read the patent application. The construction of the claims takes place in the context of the specification as a whole, recognising the existence and role of the different parts thereof, the Court having placed itself in the position of someone acquainted with the state of the art: Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236 [39]; Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 at 610; and Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd v Arico Trading International Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at 16 [24] . That said, two different people skilled in the art may take the meaning of the specification as a whole or the claims therein differently. That may reflect the perennial problem of the imprecision of language, meaning and perception or it may reflect different emphases taken from the prior art. In such cases (as to a degree is the case here) the following words of Hely J in Flexible Steel Lacing Company v Beltreco Ltd (2000) 49 IPR 331 at 350 [81] are apposite (in his Honour's always helpful, if I may respectfully say so, discussion of the principles of construction of patents at 347-350 [70]-[81]): ""As a general rule, the terms of a specification should be accorded their ordinary English meaning. Evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words which might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning. However, the construction of the specification is for the Court, not for the expert witness. Insofar as a view expressed by an expert depends upon a reading of the patent, it cannot carry the day unless the Court reads the patent in the same way.""

Case17973,cited,Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187,"applicants submitted that the view that s 251G did not prescribe a topic which permitted the production of information was supported by three authorities: Smorgon v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1976] HCA 53 ; (1976) 134 CLR 475 ; Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187 ; O'Reilly v Commissioners of State Bank of Victoria (1983) 153 CLR 1. The notice was addressed to Armstrong Scalisi Holdings Pty Ltd. The applicants contended that a notice could not be addressed to a corporation but only to its proper officer. In truth, there were two submissions here; one, a submission that a notice could not be served upon a corporation; the other, that if it was, it had to be addressed to the corporation's proper officer. These arguments are, so it seems to me, quite without substance. It has been accepted that a corporation cannot be required physically to attend and give evidence for the very good reason that it is an abstraction lacking physical form: Smorgon v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group [1976] HCA 53 ; (1976) 134 CLR 475 at 481-482 per Stephen J. However, that physical constraint has no impact on the ability of a corporation to answer questions. It is for that reason well established that a corporation may be required to provide information. Indeed, Lockhart J described the contrary argument as ""fallacious"" in Fieldhouse v Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 25 FCR 187 at 198, an observation with which I respectfully agree. Burchett and Hill JJ also rejected the argument (at 203 and 218 respectively). The power in reg 168(2) to require production of books and documents is a power to produce books and documents in the custody of the person receiving the notice. It does not extend to require a party to bring documents into existence: Fieldhouse at 194-195 per Lockhart J, 204 per Burchett J and 209 per Hill J. It follows that the notice could not lawfully require the production by CAP of copies of original documents held by it. Of course, it is possible that the notice did not on its proper construction seek the creation of documents but instead the production of any copy documents which were in fact held. Lockhart J canvassed this possibility in Fieldhouse at 194-195. In this case, I do not think that the natural and ordinary meaning of subparagraphs (a), (c), (d) and (g) is that they require production of copies already in existence. It follows that these paragraphs are not supported by reg 168(2). Even if that were not so, however, the subparagraphs are ambiguous in that they leave the recipient unsure whether production of copies already existing is called for or whether copies of originals are to be made. The notice is, therefore, also bad for uncertainty: cf. Commissioner of Taxation v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1979) 143 CLR 499 at 525 per Gibbs CJ; Fieldhouse at 193 per Lockhart J, 204 per Burchett J and 210 per Hill J. FAILURE TO SPECIFY MATTER It has been held that a notice under s 264 which is bad in part may be severed. So much was held by Burchett J in Fieldhouse at 204 and by Hill J at 210. Lockhart J clearly assumed such a power to exist. However, on the facts in Fieldhouse , both Lockhart and Burchett JJ thought that severance was not practical because the provision of the copies was central to the notice so that parts of it no longer made sense if the paragraphs dealing with copies were excised. Hill J, on the other hand, did not share this concern. I do not think that the notice in this case suffers from that problem. Paragraphs (a), (c), (d) and (g) can be severed from the notice without the balance of it losing coherence. It should be noted in passing that the form of reg 168(2) may well present difficulties of application in the case of electronically held records, but it is not, presently, necessary to address the issues thereby arising. Interference with course of criminal jurisdiction Sam also challenged the notice on the general ground of its capacity to interfere with the criminal proceedings facing him. It is, I think, important to bring out into the open a suppressed premise upon which that argument rested. It was that the notice presently requires CAP to do something. In fact, the time for compliance with the notice expired on 9 February 2009 and it is no longer capable of being complied with. There is presently no legal obligation upon CAP to provide the information sought in the notice. It would not be possible to obtain a court order to compel CAP to provide the information. In a real sense, the notice is spent. The possible relevance of the notice seems therefore only to be twofold: (a) Although it is no longer capable of being complied with, the non-compliance may have been a criminal offence. If the information which was originally required by the notice were now volunteered by CAP it might be relevant to any penalty which was imposed upon it. A related concern, I would think, is the capacity of the continuing failure to provide the information to constitute professional misconduct. Voluntary production may well be likely reduce the seriousness of these matters. The Board itself made this point in its letter of 6 March 2009 which in terms said: As the Board has not withdrawn its Notice to give evidence to the Board dated 16 January 2009, you are required to comply. Failure to do so may result in prosecution under regulation 168 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . Any conviction may reflect poorly on your good fame, integrity, character and fitness and propriety. (b) It is possible that CAP may be prosecuted for a failure to comply with the notice. Despite these rather indirect incentives to provide the information to the Board, there was no evidence before me that CAP was proposing now to do so. David's evidence on this issue was: I wanted the Notice issue determined as I do not want to be prosecuted for failure to comply. I do not want to be issued with further notices that I believe are beyond what the Board is entitled to serve. Sam gave no evidence on this issue at all. There is, therefore, no evidence that CAP is intending voluntarily to produce the information previously sought in the notice. It is not the case that CAP is under a present obligation to provide the information sought. In that circumstance, the notice appears to present no real risk to the conduct of the criminal proceedings against Sam. Absent a real risk to the administration of justice in those proceedings, the notice should not be set aside on the basis that it constitutes a contempt: BLF at 56 per Gibbs CJ. Conclusion"
Case4580,considered,Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618,"Court is required to make two main inquiries. The first is whether the applicant has made out a prima facie case in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the applicant will be held to be entitled to relief. The second is whether the inconvenience or injury to the applicant if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury the respondent would suffer if the injunction were granted: Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; (1968) 118 CLR 618 ; Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57. Their Honours then referred to what was said in Beecham at 622: How strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights [the plaintiff] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order he seeks. The debate which had existed as to whether an applicant for interlocutory injunctive relief required to demonstrate a ""prima facie"" case, or a ""serious question to be tried"", a phrase, derived from the speech of Lord Diplock in American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975] UKHL 1 ; [1975] AC 396 at 407 was resolved. These expressions may be used interchangeably so long as their meaning is understood. As their Honours said at [70]: There is then no objection to the use of the phrase ""serious question"" if it is understood as conveying the notion that the seriousness of the question, like the strength of the probability referred to in Beecham , depends upon the considerations emphasised in Beecham ."

With respect to the third breach (the anticipatory breach), for example, there is a question as to whether a plaintiff's election to hold the party to the agreement rather than rescind means that it cannot claim damages. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that some authorities suggest that anticipatory breach entitles Coles to damages only if it terminates the Offer Letter: see Progressive Mailing House Pty Ltd v Tabali Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 14 ; (1985) 157 CLR 17 , 48 and Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 , 416-417, 441-442).

Case18531,considered,R v Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; (1906) 3 CLR 770,"Caltex submitted that the residual oils were at no time ""delivered"" for home consumption because the concept of delivery in the Excise Act signifies a transfer of actual or constructive possession from one person to another. In this case, it said, there was no such transfer because it used the residual oils itself at its own premises. Caltex relied on a passage from O'Connor J's judgment in R v Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; (1906) 3 CLR 770 ( Lyon ), where his Honour in the context of the customs legislation dealt with the provision for customs control over goods ""until delivery for home consumption or exportation"" (which provision is mirrored in s 61 of the Excise Act ). His Honour stated at 784: The object of that provision, if it were necessary to give any reasons for its enactment, is obvious; if once goods go into home consumption, that is, into circulation, it becomes almost impossible to trace them. 136 According to Caltex, goods such as the residual oils which never leave its premises cannot be said to ""go ... into circulation"" and cannot therefore have been ""delivered"" for home consumption. 139 The Commissioner's submissions can be summarised as follows: (a) Upon their manufacture, Caltex did not sell or export the residual oils. It dedicated them for its own use as refinery fuel at the relevant premises. Its dedication of the oils for that use is plain on the evidence, which demonstrates that Caltex maintained and consumed the oils for that purpose. (b) The expression ""delivered for home consumption"" (ss 61 and 61C) is broad and should not be read down as applying only to delivery of goods between individuals or between places. Nor should ""home consumption"" be limited by reference to the identity of the actual consumer (i.e. whether the consumer is a third party or the manufacturer him or herself). (c) The concept of delivery for home consumption is critical to s 61(1) because it determines the period of the Commissioner's control over excisable goods. In s 61(1), the concept exists to distinguish between two places for consumption Australia (home) or overseas (export). The use of the preposition ""for"" in the phrases ""delivered for home consumption"" and ""delivered for exportation"", demonstrate the section is concerned more broadly with the place of consumption rather than the transfer of possession between parties. (d) The phrase ""go into circulation"" used by O'Connor J in Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 was intended to explain the concept of home consumption not delivered for home consumption. That much is clear from the context in which his Honour used the phrase, being an explanation of the customs authorities' control over goods as a form of security until payment of the required duty. Here, Caltex's premises are in Australia and consumption of the residual oils within those premises is sufficient for the oils to ""go into circulation"". (e) The residual oils were delivered for home consumption in a manner provided for by the Excise Act . They were delivered pursuant to Caltex's permissions under s 61C and that delivery gave rise to a deemed entry for home consumption: see s 61C(2). Accordingly, Caltex was required as a condition of its permission to include the residual oils in its weekly return and pay the corresponding duty. 141 Another way of considering this is by reference to s 61. Section 61 renders all excisable goods ""subject to [the Commissioner's] control until delivered for home consumption or for exportation to a place outside Australia, whichever occurs first"". The control residing with the Commissioner is of broad scope and is critical for the protection of the Commonwealth's excise revenue: see Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Collector of Customs (New South Wales) v Southern Shipping Co Ltd [1962] HCA 20 ; (1962) 107 CLR 279 ( Southern Shipping ). The section contemplates that excisable goods will be delivered for either home consumption or exportation. In my view the section evinces a legislative intention to cover the field in respect of all forms of internal (home) consumption and all exports. Historically, excise duties have been understood as running together with and supplementary to the customs duties traditionally imposed on certain goods. In Philip Morris Ltd v Commissioner of Business Franchises (Victoria) [1989] HCA 38 ; (1989) 167 CLR 399 at 427, Mason CJ and Deane J approved the following passage from Quick and Garran's Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth (1901): The fundamental conception of the term [excise] is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in a country. In the taxation of such articles of luxury, as spirits, beer, tobacco, and cigars, it has been the practice to place a certain duty on the importation of these articles and a corresponding or reduced duty on similar articles produced or manufactured in the country; and this is the sense in which excise duties have been understood in the Australian colonies, and in which the expression was intended to be used in the Constitution of the Commonwealth. 143 Contrary to Caltex's submissions, I do not accept that the reference in Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 to goods going into circulation necessitates a more restricted construction of ""delivered for home consumption"". Justice O'Connor's reference to going into circulation was used to explain how effective security over goods is lost once they have entered home consumption. His Honour was not there describing the concept of delivery nor, more importantly, intending to limit its scope. He was drawing attention to the policy of the customs legislation and the importance of the customs authorities' having a form of security over imported goods to ensure the payment of duty. I agree with the Commissioner that Caltex's dedication of the residual oils for consumption by it at its premises is sufficient, in the sense O'Connor J had in mind, for the oils to ""go into circulation"". 144 Similarly I reject Caltex's submission that the words ""from a place"" in s 61C mean that excisable goods must be removed from that place before they can be considered ""delivered"" for home consumption. Again, while Caltex's construction accords with what will occur in the typical case, the section is not limited to that situation. The section also accommodates and is consistent with a delivery for home consumption constituted by a use of the relevant goods at that place. Furthermore, the reference to a place in s 61C seems to me to be more concerned with the manner in which the Commissioner's control can be effectively exercised. Section 61C follows ss 61 , 61A and 61B , each of which concern itself with the Commissioner's control and the granting of permissions. In the case of s 61C , it seems to me that it is a necessary or at least convenient measure in permitting deliveries into home consumption without formal entries, that such activity is authorised only in respect of certain specified premises at which the Commissioner's control and supervision can be effectively exercised. 145 For these reasons, I consider that Caltex delivered the residual oils for home consumption pursuant to its s 61C permissions. Accordingly, if I am wrong on the ""refined"" point, then Caltex was obliged to account for the residual oils in its weekly returns and is liable to pay the requisite duty on them. 154 In relation to (b), Caltex's submission has the effect that s 60 could only operate where excisable goods have not in fact been delivered for home consumption. The Commissioner submitted that s 60 applies whether or not goods have been delivered for home consumption. He emphasised that the purpose of the Commissioner's control over excisable goods is to ensure that duty is properly paid (relying on Lyon [1906] HCA 17 ; 3 CLR 770 and Southern Shipping [1962] HCA 20 ; 107 CLR 279) and the obligations imposed by s 60 are designed to ensure that the goods do not find their way into home consumption without proper payment (relying on Sidebottom [2000] FCA 607 ; 98 FCR 579). More particularly the Commissioner said that s 60 is aimed directly at the unauthorised relinquishment of possession, which would include delivering goods for home consumption in a manner that was not authorised, principally where there is no payment of duty."

Case9092,cited,"Shark Bay Tuna Farms Pty Ltd v Executive Director, Fisheries WA [2000] WASC 79","was a good deal of debate before me as to whether the power in s 32(8) to vary or revoke a condition attached to a fishing permit could only be exercised during the period of the permit and for a purpose related to the fishing activities undertaken, or to be undertaken pursuant to the permit. That question raises difficult issues which I will refrain from addressing because it is not necessary for me to do so. I would only say that the decision to which the first respondent referred, Shark Bay Tuna Farms Pty Ltd v Executive Director, Fisheries WA [2000] WASC 79 , is, with respect, of no real assistance because it is a decision dealing with quite a different statutory scheme (see at [30]-[41] per Wheeler J)."
Case17814,referred to,Citron v Z&uuml;ndel (No 4) (2002) 41 CHRR D/74 ,"her Honour found that the respondent controlled the Adelaide Institute and thereby was responsible for its actions, and for the material which was published on the Adelaide Institute's websites. She found that the material contained in the AI Document conveyed the imputations which were the subject matters of the orders mentioned above. She found that publishing material on a website which is not password protected had the effect of communicating that information to the public. Such publication allows persons who access the website with a browser to view the material. Her Honour described how the material moves through the World Wide Web by relying on the description given in the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in Citron v Z&uuml;ndel (No 4) (2002) 41 CHRR D/74 at [60]: The Internet is a means of global communication that relies on a universal set of protocols or standards for the transmission of information. Two related sets of communication instructions, Transmission Control Protocol, (TCP) and Internet Protocol, (IP), govern how information will move through the system, defining addresses, routing systems, and all the regulation necessary to permit communication among users. Her Honour also relied on the Tribunal's description of the World Wide Web at [67]: The World Wide Web, (the ""Web""), is a specific application that uses the Internet to send and display data, including text, graphics, audio and video. There are two active components on the Web: a server that stores and transmits information, and a client or browser that requests, receives and displays the information obtained from the server. A ""web site"" is a collection of computer files that are coded in a specific way ... to allow information to be sent on request to a browser. The files are then displayed in a way consistent with the instructions provided by the creator of the web site. Every web site has a unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL), akin to their Internet address. Once connected to the Internet, the URL ... is necessary to gain access to a given web site ... Her Honour found that publication of the AI Document on the World Wide Web amounted to conduct which was rendered unlawful by the Racial Discrimination Act and made a declaration accordingly. Her Honour found that the AI Document and other material published by the respondent on the World Wide Web conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2 of the September 2002 orders. Her Honour found that the first and second imputations would engender feelings of hurt and pain within members of the Jewish Community who would, by reason of the publication, consider themselves being treated contemptuously, disrespectfully and offensively. She also found that the third and fourth imputations would offend, insult, hurt and wound members of the Jewish Community and engender the same senses. The judge found that the publication of the AI Document was unlawful under s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act and that it was published because of the ethnic origin of the people in the group identified in the document, namely Jews and it was an act reasonably likely to humiliate and intimidate Jewish people. The judge found that the respondent had not established any exceptions under s 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act . Her Honour made a permanent injunction restraining the respondent first, from publishing to the public on the World Wide Web the AI Document or any document with substantially similar content to that document; and secondly, from publishing any material which would convey the imputations which she had previously found to be unlawful. The respondent's reaction The respondent appealed against the September 2002 orders. The respondent deleted all material on the website within the time prescribed by paragraph 1 of her Honour's orders. That action indicates an awareness of the September 2002 orders. However, some time before 23 September 2002, the material which was contained in the AI Document was again published on the same website. On 14 December 2002 the respondent attended the 3 rd International Historical Revisionism Conference in Italy and published further material on the website. On 5 February 2003 the respondent entered the September 2002 orders. Initially the respondent argued that the sealed order now on file did not reflect her Honour's reasons but that argument was abandoned. The respondent's appeal On 22 April 2003 the respondent filed an amended notice of appeal against the September 2002 orders. The notice of appeal did not challenge the finding made by Branson J that publication of the material was conduct which was rendered unlawful by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act , being conduct which was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate and intimidate the groups or persons identified by her Honour. Three matters were argued on the appeal. First, that Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act was unconstitutional. Secondly, the material which had been published on the website did not have a sufficient degree of causal connection with race, colour or national or ethnic origin as required by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . Thirdly, the published material fell within the exemption to the provisions of Part IIA in s 18D. In May 2003, at or about the time the matter was heard by the Full Court, the respondent published on the website ""that the appeal would signal how strong the Jewish Zionist influence is in Australia's judiciary where a battle rages between common law and talmudic law."" The Full Court dismissed the respondent's challenge to the validity of Part IIA of the Racial Discrimination Act . Carr and Kiefel JJ found that the provisions of Part IIA were supported by the external affairs power. Allsop J found that Part IIA , ss 18C and 18C (1)(b) ""in its statutory context, are reasonably capable of being considered as appropriate and adopted to implement the obligations ... assumed by Australia"" under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination done at New York on 7 March 1966. The Full Court found that the AI Document was calculated to offend in itself those who maintain that the holocaust occurred and, in particular, Jewish people. It concluded at least one reason the AI Document was published was because of the race or ethnic origin of Jewish Australians. It found that the AI Document was deliberately provocative and inflammatory, and contrived to smear Jews. It rejected the respondent's contention that he was entitled to an exemption by reason of s 18D(b) which provides that s 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any publication made for genuine academic or other genuine purpose in the public interest. I disagree. The intention of the September 2002 orders is to prevent Dr Toben from continuing to engage in conduct that is rendered unlawful by s 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act . The September 2002 orders were designed to achieve that result in two ways. First, in paragraph 2 by requiring Dr Toben to remove from the Adelaide Institute website the AI Document and any other material which conveyed the imputations in paragraph 2(a)(iii). Branson J made that clear when she approved at [111] the approach taken by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal which considered the utility of making any order in a similar case. In the case of Citron v Z&uuml;ndel 41 CHRR D/74, the Tribunal said at [300]: Any remedy awarded by this, or any Tribunal, will inevitably serve a number of purposes: prevention and elimination of discriminatory practises is only one of the outcomes flowing from an Order issued as a consequence of these proceedings. There is also a significant symbolic value in the public denunciation of the actions that are the subject of this complaint. Similarly, there is the potential educative and ultimately larger preventative benefit that can be achieved by open discussion of the principles enunciated in this or any Tribunal decision. Paragraph 3 of the orders was designed to ensure that once there had been compliance with paragraph 2 of the orders, conduct of the kind which gave rise to the declaration in paragraph 1 would not be repeated. To that end, paragraph 3 restrains Dr Toben from publishing the AI Document anywhere on the World Wide Web and further restrains him from publishing material with substantially similar content to that document. It was necessary to include paragraph 3(b) because otherwise it might have been said by Dr Toben that he was entitled to publish on the World Wide Web information which was in slightly different form to that which was contained in the AI Document. Paragraph 3(c) of the orders is designed to reflect, insofar as future conduct is concerned, that which Dr Toben was obliged to remove from the World Wide Web website in accordance with paragraph 2(a)(iii). In my opinion, the orders are not imprecise or vague and uncertain. They do not become so because they require the party to whom they are directed to make a subjective assessment of the material which may be published on the World Wide Web."
Case7934,referred to,Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249,"Under Pt 3 - 90 of the 1997 Act , the consolidated group is treated as a single taxpayer represented by the head company. The assets of a subsidiary member are treated as being held by the head company. As already noted, the head company inherits the tax history of the subsidiary member when it joins the group. Plainly enough, the regime established by Pt 3 - 90 is intended to reflect, within the tax framework, the commercial and economic realities of corporate group dealings: compare s 700-10. See generally Envestra Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2008] FCA 249 at [6] - [9] per Mansfield J. As his Honour commented in Envestra at [6], ""[t]hat process obviously required rules, including to set the cost for income tax purposes of the assets that a subsidiary member would bring into the group"". Just as rules are needed for this purpose, so too rules are needed to govern the situation when a subsidiary member leaves the group. A subsidiary member leaves the group when it ceases to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the head company. 57 As the earlier discussion shows, the drafting style used in Pt 3 - 90 is a distinctive one: it specifically directs attention to the objects of the scheme as a whole and in respect of aspects of the scheme, and to the particular principles that are instrumental in achieving these objects: see e.g., ss 700-10, 701 -15(2) &amp; (3), 705 -10(2) &amp; (3) and 711-5(2) &amp; (3). The more detailed provisions, or 'rules', that are to be applied to give effect to these principles are to be construed in light of these principles and objects. 58 This appeal is concerned with what happens when a subsidiary leaves the group. The object of Division 711, which governs this situation, is set out in s 711-5, namely, ""to preserve the alignment of the head company's costs for membership interests ... established when entities become subsidiary members"": s 711-5(2). The means by which this is to be achieved is ""by recognising the head company's cost for those interests, just before the leaving time , as an amount equal to the cost of the leaving entity's assets at the leaving time reduced by the amount of its liabilities"": s 711-5(3). The legislation is directed to quantifying the head company's cost for membership interests ""just before the leaving time"", to be done in the manner indicated. This is the principle that is intended to achieve the object of preserving the relevant alignment."
Case1015,referred to,Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341,"meaning of the word 'contravention' is critical for the present proceedings. The word has been defined in cases other than Dimella to mean ' a failure to obey a statutory command...by doing something that a statute says must not be done ': see Re Centennial Coal Co Ltd (2006) 226 ALR 341 at 346 per Barrett J; ' an infringement or violation of a rule or standard or norm ': see Re Venice Nominees at 242 per Miles CJ; '"" infringe (law); (of things) conflict with""' per Owen J in Elkington v Vockbay Pty Ltd; Vockbay Pty Ltd v Elkington (1993) 10 ACSR 785 at 803; and ' an act or omission which is blameworthy and may lead to civil or criminal consequences ' per Young J in NRMA Ltd v Gould and Others (1995) 18 ACSR 290 at 293. The word has been defined in various UK statues as ' failure to comply ': see, for example, ss 5(1) and 37(1) Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (UK); s 53(1) Food and Safety Act 1990 (UK). Generally, authorities show that in ascertaining the meaning of the word the most important consideration is the statutory framework within which the word operates. For example, in Centennial Coal , Barrett J defined contravention as conventionally meaning that which was mentioned above, but went on to say: In the present context, however, ""contravention"" must be accepted as having a wider meaning. Section 1322(4)(a) is a remedial provision and the word ""contravention"" must, therefore, ""be read in a very wide sense""... Can one contravene an offence section if a defence is available?"
Case14425,distinguished,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426,"Finally, even if an item of expenditure cannot be traced to a particular item of income that fact of itself does not mean that the expenditure is not deductible: Total Holdings at 224 and the authorities there cited. However, an item of expenditure may not be deductible if it was incurred at a point too soon before the income producing activity commenced or if it was incurred after the income producing activity has ceased: Steele at [44]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Maddalena (1971) 45 ALJR 426; Riverside Road Lodge at 313; Amalgamated Zinc at 309 and AGC (Advances) at 197-198. 56 The phrase ""come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income"" was first used by Menzies J in Maddalena . However, that is not what occurred here. The Commissioner's reliance upon Maddalena is misplaced. The case is distinguishable on a number of bases. 57 The management fee was expenditure outlayed within a framework in which Spriggs, as a professional footballer, produced his income. That framework was the AFL Player Rules, the Representation Agreement and the Standard AFL Playing Contract. That framework has to be considered in context including Mr Shinners' evidence that it is rare for a player to negotiate his own playing contract and that he estimates 90% of AFL players currently have an accredited agent. 58 Moreover, the management fee was not incurred prior to the generation of the income. The income was ongoing. The income that was generated as a result of the negotiations of the Accredited Agent was, in each year (except 2004), from two necessarily related sources. One of those sources was the playing contract. The other was his additional services which he was able to provide only because he was a contracted AFL player. The term of Spriggs' playing contracts varied from between 1 and 2 years. For each year of each of the playing contracts negotiated by Connors of CSM, the Representation Agreement imposed an obligation on Spriggs to pay a percentage of his Football Payments to CSM. 61 Some analogies may or may not be apposite. And argument by analogy must never be allowed to obscure the particularity of the arrangements in question. Maddalena concerned an era of professional sportsmen and women which bears little or no resemblance to professional sport in the twenty first century. One only has to point to the absence of the electronic media, let alone the internet, in the 1930's to make good that proposition. Secondly, the factual matrix in Maddalena is very different to the factual matrix of Spriggs. 62 In Maddalena , Menzies J described the taxpayer and the issue in the following terms (at 548-9): ""The question is whether the taxpayer, who earns his living as an electrician and as a professional footballer, is entitled to deductions under s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act [ 1936 (Cth)] of travelling expenses, and under s 51 and 64A of the Act of legal expenses, incurred by him in seeking and obtaining a new contract with a new club to play football. ... Of course, in his career as a professional footballer, a player who is successful ordinarily moves from grade to grade and from club to club. His employment is part-time and it is common for a player to play football in representative teams as well as with his club ... Furthermore, it is common knowledge that because a man is a successful professional he can earn fees from advertising and other sources which, of course, form part of his assessable income. Nothing I say in this judgment bears upon expenditure to earn such fees. Here it is the agreement with Newtown that the taxpayer spent money to secure."" (Emphasis added.) 63 Spriggs was a full time professional footballer. Maddalena was not. Spriggs seeks to claim the management fee as a deduction. That fee was incurred after the playing contract was signed, not before, and could not be charged if no playing contract was negotiated. Maddalena sought to claim travelling expenses and legal expenses, expenses which were incurred before the playing contract and which were incurred regardless of whether or not a playing contract was secured. The management fee incurred by Spriggs did not "" come at a point too soon to be properly regarded as incurred in gaining assessable income "". 64 In relation to the ""negative limb"" of s 8-1 of the 1997 Act , the Commissioner submitted that even if the management fee was an outgoing incurred by Spriggs in gaining or producing assessable income, it was on capital, not revenue, account and therefore not deductible under s 8-1 of the 1997 Act . This argument also fails."
Case19414,cited,Plantagenet Wines v Lyon Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247,"Although references occur in the Authorities to the 'inherent jurisdiction' of the Court ( McDermott v Richmond Sales (in liq) [2006] FCA 248 , per Kenny J; Plantagenet Wines v Lyon Nathan Wine Group Australia Ltd [2006] FCA 247 , per Sciopis J) the term is an inaccurate description of the 'incidental and necessary power' exercised by a statutory court ( DJL v Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 241[25], per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron J, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) as the term 'inherent jurisdiction' is a reference to a jurisdiction subsisting 'without the aid of any authorising provisions' ( R v Forbes ; ex parte Bevan per Menzies J, at p 7). The distinction between a jurisdiction or power derived by implication from statutory provisions and a jurisdiction drawn from the 'well of undefined powers available to the common law courts at Westminster'( Grassby v The Queen [1989] HCA 45 ; (1989) 168 CLR 1 at 16) is 'fundamental' ( DJL v Central Authority [26])."
Case5539,applied,Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (No. 3) [2003] FCA 651,"Honour further observed (at [8]) that the principles that govern the circumstances in which an order will be made under O 29 r 2 are relatively well established and she summarised them in a fashion which I gratefully adopt: '(a) the term ""question"" in O 29 r 1 includes any question or issue of fact or law in a proceeding. The distinction in the rule between an ""issue"" and a ""question"" is the distinction between that which, when resolved, will result in an adjudication in favour of one party or the other, being an ""issue"", and less decisive matters of dispute being ""questions"" ( Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq) v REI Building Society (1993) 41 FCR 421 at 425; 113 ALR 643 at 647); (b) a question can be the subject of an order for a separate decision under O 29 r 2 even though a decision on such a question will not determine any of the parties' rights ( Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq) v REI Building Society at FCR 245; ALR 647); (c) however, the judicial determination of a question under O 29 r 2 must involve a conclusive or final decision based on concrete and established or agreed facts for the purpose of quelling a controversy between the parties ( Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 334; 161 ALR 399; [1999] HCA 9 at [45] ); (d) where the preliminary question is one of mixed fact and law, it is necessary that the question can be precisely formulated and that all of the facts that are on any fairly arguable view relevant to the determination of the question are ascertainable either as facts assumed to be correct for the purposes of the preliminary determination, or as agreed facts or as facts to be judicially determined ( Jacobson v Ross [1995] 1 VR 337 at 341, referring to Nissan v Attorney-General [1969] UKHL 3 ; [1970] AC 179 at 242-243 per Lord Pearson; Bass v Perpetual Trustee at [53]); (e) care must be taken in utilising the procedure provided for in O 29 r 1 to avoid the determination of issues not ""ripe"" for separate and preliminary determination. An issue may not be ""ripe"" for separate and preliminary determination in this sense where it is simply one of two or more alternative ways in which an applicant frames its case and determination of the issue would leave significant other issues unresolved ( CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill (1985) 1 NSWLR 601 per Kirby P at 606); (f) factors which tend to support the making of an order under O 29 r 2 include that the separate determination of the question may (i) contribute to the saving of time and cost by substantially narrowing the issues for trial, or even lead to disposal of the action; or (ii) contribute to the settlement of the litigation ( CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill per Kirby P at 607); (g) factors which tell against the making of an order under O 29 r 2 include that the separate determination of the question may - (i) give rise to significant contested factual issues both at the time of the hearing of the preliminary question and at the time of trial ( GMB Research &amp; Development Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1997] FCA 934 ; (ii) result in significant overlap between the evidence adduced on the hearing of the separate question and at trial possibly involving the calling of the same witnesses at both stages of the hearing of the proceeding: GMB Research &amp; Development Pty Ltd v Commonwealth ; Arnold v Attorney-General (Vic) (unreported, Fed C of A, Sundberg J, Nos VG 629-37 of 1995, 8 September 1995, BC9502745). This factor will be of particular significance if the Court may be required to form a view as to the credibility of witnesses who may give evidence at both stages of the hearing of the proceeding; or (iii) prolong rather than shorten the litigation ( GMB Research &amp; Development Pty Ltd v Commonwealth ).' As French J observed in Olbers Co Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia (No. 3) [2003] FCA 651 at [8] : 'The overarching consideration informing the discretion to make an order under O 29 r 2 is efficient case management.' The Institute made the following submissions in support of its motion: (1) The conduct complained of by David Jones was not, on the Institute's part, conduct in trade or commerce for various reasons including that the media release and the further media release were not made for any business purposes of the Institute or Dr Hamilton but for the public benefit and to engender, participate in and foster public debate with the ultimate aim of, as suggested in the Discussion Paper, instigating improvements to the regulatory system for marketing and advertising of this kind. (2) An answer favourable to the Institute on the issue of whether its conduct is in trade or commerce would be a complete answer to David Jones' case; and (3) The evidence on the threshold issue of whether the conduct of the Institute complained of is in trade or commerce is discrete and totally, or almost totally, quarantined from the merits issues whether the conduct was misleading or deceptive and whether there was any contravention of the TPA. In furtherance of the submission in [16](3) above, the Institute submitted that the expert evidence in this case is entirely limited to the merits issues whether or not the conduct engaged in was misleading or deceptive and that apart from some accounting evidence, there is no expert evidence that could be called or would be helpful to the issue of whether the Institute or Dr Hamilton engaged in trade or commerce. This is why, the submission went, there is the potential for such an enormous cost saving and saving of court time because the contravention issues involve a very wide range of expert evidence, the nature of which is outlined in Ex. 2. It was submitted on behalf of the Institute that if there was an issue of credit, it might go to, for example, the sort of business the Institute is engaged in and the extent to which the discussion papers were published for a commercial purpose. Such credit issues would not be significant; they are not expected to overlap with the same issue on the merits part of the case; it is not expected that the same lay witnesses who would be called on the question of the business activities of the Institute would also be giving evidence about the nature of the advertising or the nature of the conduct engaged in by David Jones. Finally, the Institute submitted that, if there was a separate issue ordered and decided, the fact that it might generate an appeal was not a relevant factor. As to the possibility that the resolution of the question posed in a particular way would dispose of the proceedings or significantly shorten them with an attendant saving in time and money, one is reminded of what French J said in Olbers at [31]: '... any prophesied economies are to be balanced against the fragmentation of the trial of the issue. Experience in the courts over many years has demonstrated that fragmentation of proceedings rarely result in any saving of time in the long run and that projections as to costs savings are likely at best to be speculative.'"

By contrast, with the documents in question there is no witness equivalent to Ms Shelton or Professor Layton.

Case13948,cited,Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (2006) 224 ALR 490,"Jarbin Pty Ltd v Clutha Ltd (in liq) (2004) 208 ALR 242, Campbell J concluded at [68] that s 564 operates as an exception to the prima facie equality of treatment of ""all unsecured creditors within the respective classes which s 556 recognises"". Barrett J in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (2006) 224 ALR 490 accepted at [8] that as a matter of power the Court may under s 564 make an order that causes a creditor chosen for preferred treatment to rank ahead of ""any one or more of the creditors having claims within the s 556(1) categories"". That construction was said to follow firstly because s 556(1) is subject to Division 6 and thus subject to the power conferred on the Court by s 564 and secondly, because s 564 provides that a preferred creditor may be given an advantage "" over others in consideration of the risk assumed"". At [9], Barrett J said this: Section 564 contemplates that assisting or indemnifying creditors within its purview may be given ""an advantage over others"". The section does not say ""all others"" or ""some others"" or ""any others"". In referring to ""others"" generally, it contemplates, in my view, that the court may, by its order, give the assisting or indemnifying creditors ""an advantage over"" any one or more of the other creditors or all of them, with the result that the court may, as a matter of jurisdiction, cause the debts of the creditors in question to be placed on any of the rungs of the ladder of priority created by s 556(1) (and, within a particular rung, above, below or beside the creditors with claims that s 559 causes to rank equally inter se), above the topmost of those rungs or below the bottom rung (yet ahead of ""all other unsecured debts and claims""). In short, s 564 is cast in terms giving the court a complete discretion regarding positioning of the whole or any part of the debts of the assisting or indemnifying creditors on the scale of priorities in the winding up and the opening words of s 556(1) cause any such positioning ordered by the court to have effect despite what would otherwise be the order of priority under s 556(1). It is clear from the liquidator's letter of 2 June 2006 and cl 9 of the Indemnity Agreement of 6 February 2007 that the indemnity was to be provided by the Deputy Commissioner on the footing that where an amount was recovered or received by the liquidator arising out of the processes sought to be undertaken through the use of the indemnity, the liquidator would apply to the Court for an order that the indemnifying creditor would receive priority for the amount of the indemnity. That position was also an element of the proposal in relation to the further indemnity. Having regard to the expectations reflected in the liquidator's letter of 2 June 2006, it seems that the parties proceeded on the basis that property (an amount) recovered by reason of the various processes would significantly exceed the costs of recovery and would thus be productive of a fund of money from which distributions would be made in part reduction of the Deputy Commissioner's debt, after redemption of the indemnity amount. Part reduction of the debts of the trade creditors of $27,071.34 in the aggregate, may have been unlikely. In any event, redemption of the amount of the indemnity was to be a priority. The debt to the Deputy Commissioner was revised on 5 June 2007 to $128,927.61. In the result, the settlement funds fall well short of meeting the costs and expenses of recovery. The authorities ( Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd v TJF EBC Pty Ltd (supra); Household Financial Services Pty Ltd v Chase Medical Centre Pty Ltd (1995) 18 ACSR 294; State Bank of New South Wales v Brown (2001) 38 ACSR 715) demonstrate that in exercising the discretion consideration needs to be given to the risk run by the indemnifying creditor in providing the indemnity; the value of the property recovered or the sum recovered; the failure of other creditors to participate in providing an indemnity; the proportions between the debt due to the indemnifying creditor and other debts; the public interest in encouraging creditors to provide indemnities so as to enable a liquidator to pursue remedies which would result in recovery of the property of the company; and all other relevant circumstances."
Case4148,discussed,Re Coles Group Ltd [2007] VSC 389,"In FT Eastment &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Metal Roof Decking Supplies Pty Ltd (1977) 3 ACLR 69 at 72, Street CJ said: [T]he court will not ordinarily summon a meeting unless the scheme is of such a nature and cast in such terms, if it achieves the statutory majority at the creditor's meeting [in this case, the members' meeting] the court would be likely to approve it on the hearing of a petition which is unopposed. That passage was cited with approval by the High Court in Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Goldmines Ltd [1993] HCA 15 ; (1993) 177 CLR 485, and has been followed in many decisions since, including recently Re Coles Group Limited [2007] VSC 389 per Robson J. 30 There may be some difference of opinion, or perhaps only of emphasis, between the views of Robson J in Re Coles Group Ltd [2007] VSC 389 and Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (2007) 61 ACSR 266 as to whether it is necessary to consider s 411(17) at the first stage of the two stage process for the Court to direct the meeting and then, after the scheme is voted upon, to approve it. If that consideration is relevant at this point, that is whether there is a likelihood (or prospect) of s 411(17) being satisfied at first stage, I have the necessary level of satisfaction at this point and on the material referred to. The provisional view of ASIC referred to above indicates that there is a prospect of it producing to the Court the form of statement referred to in s 411(17)(b), although of course the Court then clearly is not obliged to approve the proposed scheme. Alternatively, on the information presently available to me, as I have indicated, I do not see a reason why, if the members of Hostworks at the proposed meeting of the scheme support the proposed scheme, I would not be satisfied that the scheme has not been proposed for the purpose of enabling any person to avoid the operation of any of the provisions of Chapter 6. That must necessarily be only a tentative and provisional judgment. However, it is accepted, as is now commonplace, that in circumstances such as the present, an entity such as Hostworks has a choice between following the takeover procedure in Chapter 6 in conjunction with Broadcast Australia or following the scheme of arrangement procedure supported by inter partes documentary agreements as contemplated by Pt 5.1 of Chapter 5 of the Act. Consequently, the mere choice of the procedure now being adopted is not an indication that a purpose of this procedure is to enable any person to avoid the operation of any provisions of Chapter 6. There will thus need to be some identification of which provision or provisions of Chapter 6 might relevantly operate so as to produce potentially a different outcome to that which would follow from the present procedure and an exploration of why the Pt 5.1 procedure has been used having regard to that provision or those provisions if s 411(17)(a) is to be enlivened. Such consideration may also be relevant to the discretion of the Court under s 411(17) if ASIC has provided a statement under s 411(17)(b). No such provision has presently been identified. 32 The performance risk concern has been raised in previous scheme of arrangement applications. They are referred to by Lindgren J in Re APN News 62 ACSR 400 at [23]. I will not repeat them. It is necessary to consider the so called ""performance risk"" of shareholders being left in a position, once the scheme has become effective, of their shares having been transferred to Broadcast Australia, but then facing a delay in the provision of the scheme consideration, so that their only remedy would be to sue on the Deed Poll. That risk has been overcome here by requiring the scheme consideration to be paid to Hostworks before 12 noon on the ""implementation date"" to be held in trust by Hostworks for the purpose of being paid to the scheme participants, that is the shareholders of Hostworks, before they are divested of their shares in Hostworks later on in the implementation date. Broadcast Australia must provide the funds to pay for the shares it is to acquire before they are transferred. A similar arrangement was satisfactory to Robson J for the purposes of authorising or directing the calling of the proposed meeting in Re Coles Group [2007] VSC 389 ; see at [38]. The Deed Poll contains a covenant on the part of Broadcast Australia to provide the scheme consideration on the implementation date in accordance with the terms of the scheme so that it ties the settlement step of payment and transfer together. 41 Under cl 7.3(a) of the Implementation Agreement, each scheme participant is deemed to have warranted that all of its shares in Hostworks which are transferred under the scheme will be free from all mortgages and encumbrances. Fryberg J in Re Mincom Ltd (No 3) (2007) 25 ACLC 207, regarded an almost identical deemed warranty clause as onerous and unreasonable and ""calculated to catapult unsuspecting shareholders who have not read the small print of the arrangement in the schedule to the explanatory statement into a state of breach of warranty"": at [21]. In Re APN News &amp; Media Ltd 62 ACSR 400, Lindgren J disagreed with the approach of Fryberg J: see at [59]-[62]. I respectfully agree with and adopt the views of Lindgren J. I share the understanding of his Honour that the purpose and effect of such a clause is simply to ensure that a scheme participant whose shares are subject to an encumbrance is not unfairly advantaged. The amount of the damages payable for breach of the warranty would be equal to the amount required to discharge the encumbrance. I note that the approach of Lindgren J has been preferred in subsequent cases, including by Robson J in Re Coles Group Limited [2007] VSC 389 at [45] ; by Lander J in Re Adelaide Bank Limited [2007] FCA 1582 at [33] ; and by Gyles J in Orion Telecommunications Ltd [2007] FCA 1389 at [9] ."

The reason is that, in my view, on any approach, the discretion should be exercised in favour of the granting of leave for the Liquidators to appoint themselves as administrators. The main question under s436B(2) of the Act is whether the Court is satisfied that the liquidator is an appropriate person to be appointed as administrator. After all, a liquidator is at liberty under s 436B(1) of the Act to appoint another person as administrator without the necessity of leave: see Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Foodcorp Pty Ltd (1994) 13 ACSR 796 ( Foodcorp) ; Re Cobar Mines Pty Ltd (rec and mgr apptd) (in liq) (1998) 30 ACSR 125; John R Turk &amp; Sons (Artarmon) Pty Ltd v Newmont Television Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 622 ; Nardell Coal Corporation Pty Ltd (recs and mgrs apptd) (in liq) (2003) 47 ACSR 122.

Case22841,considered,"Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v Russian Kurier Inc, [1998] USCA2 315 ; 153 F3d 82 (1998) ","Mr Geller examined the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Itar-Tass Russian News Agency v Russian Kurier Inc , [1998] USCA2 315 ; 153 F3d 82 (1998). He treated it as authority for the proposition that copyright ownership issues are governed by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the property at issue and the parties claiming ownership. 45 Mr Geller noted that Itar-Tass has been applied by the District Court for the Central District of California, Western Division: Lahiri v Universal Music &amp; Video Distribution Inc 513 Supp 2d 1172 (2007). 47 Mr Geller has appended to his report copies of Title 17, the cases referred to above, and others. I have read the cases. I need refer only to Itar-Tass itself. The case concerned a copyright newspaper article, and had nothing to do with films. The Court first noted that Title 17 contains no provision concerning conflicts issues. It was necessary therefore to fill the interstices of the Act by developing federal common law on the conflicts issue. The Court said: Conflicts rule for issues of ownership. Copyright is a form of property, and the usual rule is that the interests of the parties in property are determined by the law of the state with ""the most significant relationship"" to the property and the parties. ... The Restatement recognises the applicability of this principle to intangibles such as ""a literary idea"". The Court then applied that rule to the facts of the case, which as the respondents pointed out, were much more related to Russia than are the facts of the present case related to Australia. But that is neither here nor there. It is the choice of law rule that matters, not the outcome of its application in Itar-Tass . 48 The respondents relied on the evidence of Mr Reichman who has undoubted expertise in copyright law. He disagrees with Mr Geller's opinion and believes ""there is a strong possibility that the US Court will apply US Copyright law to determine copyright ownership of The Secret"". He gives his reasons. 53 The second related deficiency in Mr Geller's report concerns Itar-Tass . He records the essential reasoning of the Court in that case, but does not advert to the note appended to the following statement: To whatever extent we look to the Berne Convention itself as guidance in the development of federal common law on the conflicts issue, we find nothing to alter our conclusion. The Convention does not purport to settle issues of ownership, with one exception not relevant to this case. The note (n 12) reads in part: The Berne Convention expressly provides that ""ownership of copyright in a cinematographic work shall be a matter for legislation in the country where protection is claimed"" ... Art 14bis(2)(a). The note goes on to explore whether the Article contains any implication as to the choice of law for copyright issues other than ownership. As indicated at [46], Itar-Tass did not concern a cinematographic work. 54 One of the attachments to Mr Geller's report is his article in Journal, Copyright Society of the United States of America (2004): Conflict of Laws in Copyright Cases: Infringement and Ownership Issues . At 326 Mr Geller says: To repeat our basic point: if a field, such as copyright, has a treaty-governed ""international system"", an ordre public international, such as the Berne/TRIPs regime, then the principles of that system, to the extent relevant to choice of law, must serve as binding constraints on conflicts analysis in the field. In terms of the Second Restatement of Conflict of Laws, reading treaty commitments into the first criterion of section 6(2)(a), ""the needs of the ... international system"", help to meet other criteria of section 6. Because it is anchored in treaty principles, this approach enhances the ""certainty, predictability and uniformity of results"": The Restatement framework sets up two levels of conflicts analysis. We have already indicated that, at a first level, section 6(2)(a) of the Restatement sets out a number of criteria for generally resolving conflicts of law, the first being ""the needs of the ... international system"". The second level of analysis of the Restatement is found in provisions regarding special areas of law, for example, ... in section 222, regarding the choice of laws to govern [copyright] ownership issues. In such instances, the Restatement proposes to choose the ""local law"" of the jurisdiction which, with respect to the issue in question, has the ""most significant relationship"" to the ultimate facts of the case, but this relationship is to be determined ""under the principles stated in"" (italics added) section 6. Thus, in resolving conflicts of laws in cross-border cases under the Restatement, US courts are directed to attend to any relevant ""international system"" at the first level of analysis, in order to guide focusing on any arguable ""significant relationship"" adumbrated at the second level of analysis. Following the Restatement analysis in cross-border copyright cases, the courts should then take account of the relevant system, that is, the Berne/TRIPs regime, which the United States has implemented in the Copyright Act . Although Mr Geller does not refer to Art 14bis(2)(a), that passage provides additional support for attending to the provisions of the Berne Convention in any search by a United States court for the appropriate choice of law in a copyright ownership case. 55 Art 14bis(2)(a) directs one to the law of the country where protection is claimed. That is the law of the United States. Title 17 provides in s 104(b) that the works specified in s 102 , which include motion pictures, are ""subject to protection under this title"" if the work is first published in the United States, as the works in question here were. 68 (c) TS Production's registration under Title 17 is a clear invocation of the protection of the US copyright regime. The effect of that invocation is that under Art 5(2) of the Berne Convention, claims in the United States are governed by US law. (d) Drew Pictures has also sought to avail itself of the protection of US Copyright law. (e) The Film and the screenplay were first published in the United States. Accordingly that country is their ""country of origin"" under Art 5(4) of the Convention. (f) Title 17 grants copyright protection to joint authors of cinematograph films. If Mr Heriot makes out his case as a co-author of the screenplay and a director of the Film, he is entitled to copyright protection in the US, and it is irrelevant whether the works were conceived in Australia or partly made here. (g) Article 14bis(2)(a) of the Convention allows the US to legislate for ownership of copyright in a cinematograph film, and US law makes provision for joint ownership in films, which counsel submitted the Act does not appear to do. (h) Mr Reichman's expert evidence should be preferred to that of Mr Geller. Mr Geller's reliance on Itar-Tass is misplaced. Here the works were first published in the United States. That is their country of origin. Further, Itar-Tass observed that although the Berne Convention does not purport to settle all questions of copyright ownership, Art 14bis(2)(a) does deal with ownership of copyright in cinematic films this very case. (i) Australian law will apply in the proceeding in this Court. Title 17 will apply to the Illinois proceeding. There is no identity of issues because the two statutory regimes are different. On that basis there can be no anti-suit injunction to stop the respondents prosecuting their claim in the Illinois proceeding. (j) US domestic law will apply to infringement in the Illinois proceeding: Itar-Tass . (k) Where initial infringement occurs in the United States and subsequent infringement occurs elsewhere, United States law allows the recovery of damages for external infringement, at least if there is a causal link between the infringements: Sheldon v Metro-Goldwyn Pictures Corporation 106 F2d 45 (1939). That is not the position in Australia: s 101(1) of the Act. Thus a cross claim for infringement in this proceeding would only cover damages for infringement in Australia. (l) Joint authors of films are not known to Australian law, and that is the central claim in the Complaint. The declarations sought in the Illinois proceeding that the works are joint works, that the respondents can exploit the works independently of TS Production, and that Mr Heriot is a co-author of the works, are not available under Australian law. It is common ground that amendment of the United States copyright register can only be ordered by a United States court. (m) The provisions of the Act relied on, namely ss 22(4) and 98, are quite different from the co-ownership provisions in Title 17 on which the respondents rely in the Illinois proceeding. 74 For the reasons I have given at [49] to [55], the US court will apply United States law to the ownership dispute. If the plaintiffs establish ownership in Drew Pictures, infringement and damages or lost profits will also be governed by United States law: Itar-Tass ."

The Minister submitted that the Tribunal correctly determined their application adversely to them as at the date of the determination. In purportedly applying Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Singh (1997) 72 FCR 288 at 294 (Black CJ, Lee, von Doussa, Sundberg and Mansfield JJ), the Tribunal was evidently of the view that the appellant husband's circumstances the subject of his claims had not changed sufficiently since leaving Sir Lanka, and that the claimed threats were no more than further instances of circumstances which the Tribunal considered to have been evident at the time of the appellant husband's departure for Australia."
Case5095,considered,Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536,"requirement of materiality is, by reason of the definition of ""disease"" in s 4, a requirement that the employee's employment contribute materially to the suffering of the ailment in question ( Comcare v Sahu-Khan [2007] FCA 15 ; (2007) 156 FCR 536 at [16] per Finn J) or to the aggravation of the ailment, that is, '[i] n a material degree; substantially, considerably ' (the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary cited by Finn J in Sahu-Khan at [15]). Mr Mellor submits that, in his case, the correct question is not whether the underlying pathology of a disease or frank injury had been materially contributed to but whether the aggravation of symptoms, being an injury, had been materially contributed to. The worsening of symptoms of an injury can, he submits, be sufficient to ground liability without any change in the underlying pathology. That is, the Tribunal concluded that the employment was the cause of the aggravation represented by the pain but that the effect of that aggravation was not material because it was temporary and not severe. Is the requirement of materiality directed to the cause of the aggravation or its effect? ""Disease"" means an ailment or aggravation of an ailment ' that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment '. ""Injury"" means, relevantly, a disease or an aggravation of an injury other than a disease. In Sahu-Khan , Finn J traced the legislative history of and judicial consideration of the requirement of materiality, including the decision of the Full Court in Comcare v Canute [2005] FCAFC 262 ; (2005) 148 FCR 232. In Canute at [67], French and Stone JJ said that the term ""material"" ' imposes an evaluative threshold below which a causal connection may be disregarded '. Justice Finn in Sahu-Khan adopted that analysis at [13]. It is the nature of the contribution that is necessarily material ( Sahu-Khan at [15]). The Tribunal correctly summarised the principles in Sahu-Khan at [227]. It appreciated that there was a requirement of materiality for a causal connection to be found. However, at [286]-[287], in considering the lumbar spine, it said that because there was no lasting effect of the aggravation and no underlying change in the condition, the contribution by the employment to the lower back conditions was not material. With respect to the thoracic spine, the Tribunal stated at [260] that it did not accept that the temporary increase in Mr Mellor's symptoms represented an aggravation of his condition in a material degree. This was to confuse the requirement that the employment be a material cause of the aggravation with a requirement that the effect of the aggravation be material. The confusion on this point is also evident from [225] of the Tribunal's decision, where the following statement is made: Mr Mellor claims that his employment contributed to or aggravated all of these ailments, and that the contribution or aggravation was to a material degree so that these ailments constituted an injury within the meaning of the [SRC] Act, and therefore he is entitled to claim compensation pursuant to s 14 of the [SRC] Act. (emphasis added) The Tribunal may have been led to take this course because of the way in which the cased was argued by Mr Mellor. Australia Post submits that the requirement of materiality qualifies the word ""ailment"" in the expression ' the aggravation of any such ailment; being ... an aggravation [of any such ailment] that was contributed to in a material degree by the employee's employment '. I do not accept this to be the case. It is also inconsistent with the discussion of materiality in Canute and Sahu-Khan , although neither of those cases directly considers the issue raised in the present case. Australia Post submits that Parliament would not have intended that the Commonwealth be liable for any aggravation of disease regardless of how insignificant that aggravation might be. However, s 4 does not give effect to such an intention."

In In re William Hockley Ltd ... Pennycuick J. suggested as a definition of ""a contingent creditor"" what is perhaps rather a definition of ""a contingent or prospective creditor"", saying that in his opinion it denoted ""a person towards whom, under an existing obligation, the company may or will become subject to a present liability upon the happening of some future event or at some future date"". The importance of these words for present purposes lies in their insistence that there must be an existing obligation and that out of that obligation a liability on the part of the company to pay a sum of money will arise in a future event, whether it be an event that must happen or only an event that may happen. A building contract creates, as soon as it is entered into, an obligation upon the building owner to pay the contract price, either as a whole upon a future event or, more usually, by progress and final payments each of which is to be made on a future event. The event or events may not happen, but if and when one of them does happen the building owner, by force of the contractual obligation, must pay the builder a sum of money. It is, I think, nothing to the point that the event may be complex, as where the payment is agreed to be made when the whole or some part of the work has been done to the satisfaction of an architect as expressed in a certificate or to the satisfaction of an arbitrator as expressed in an award: the building owner is bound from the time the contract is made to pay money to the builder upon a contingency; and that in my opinion makes the builder a contingent creditor of the owner.' 72 Barwick CJ agreed with the observations of Kitto J and, inferentially, so did Windeyer J. Owen J found that the petitioning creditor was within the meaning of the expression 'contingent creditor' and therefore entitled to petition for the winding up of Community Development Pty Limited, although his Honour addressed other possible meanings of the expressions 'contingent debt' and 'contingent liability' in reaching that conclusion. 73 In The National Bank of Australasia Limited v Mason [1975] HCA 56 ; (1975) 133 CLR 191 Barwick CJ adopted the same approach as had been adopted by Kitto J in Engwirda . At 200 he said: 'There must be some present obligation to pay out of which the money may become due' for monies to be regarded as 'owing contingently'."
Case635,cited,Microsoft Corporation v TYN Electronics Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 63 IPR 137,"the formulation of Lord Wright in Sutherland has been described as ""no more than a convenient label for the various ways of assessing damages which are available in any particular case"" ( Australasian Performing Rights Association v Grebo Trading Co. Pty Ltd (1978) 23 ACTR 30 per Blackburn CJ at 31) and the question to be answered is, what loss has Jennings suffered as a result of the infringement of its copyright? ( Interfirm at 446) As to the general principles concerning the assessment of damages for breach of copyright, see Autodesk v Cheung (1990) 94 ALR 472 at 474 477; Amalgamated Mining Services Pty Ltd v Warman International Ltd [1992] FCA 542 ; (1992) 111 ALR 269 at 285; Microsoft Corporation v TYN Electronics Pty Ltd (in liq) (2005) 63 IPR 137 and Eagle Rock Entertainment Ltd &amp; Anor v Caisley (2006) 66 IPR 554. Jennings contends that it does not licence its copyright to enable third party construction to occur. It keeps its copyright in a Jennings safe harbour and uses it solely in its own construction activity. Therefore, it is said, Jennings ought not to be treated in an analogous position to an architect who might, by reason of the nature of the professional work an architect undertakes, be subject to an implied licence of the copyright in a work produced in connection with particular projects. Nor, it is said, should the hypothetical ""construct"" of a notional willing licensor and licensee be adopted as the framework for determining a surrogate measure of damages by reference to a licence fee. The pleading claims damages on the alternative bases of either a fee for use of the plan or lost profits in the construction of the Bogdan home. Presumably, the pleading does so in order to preserve alternative possible formulations of a remedy in damages in respect of proven infringing conduct. However, it is clear that the letter of demand from Jennings dated 19 November 2003 made a claim for a fee for use of the plan for an amount which remains the amount claimed as a fee for use in the amended pleading."

Brennan J there referred to adverse information that is credible, relevant and significant which the decision-maker possesses and proposes to take into account. VEAL concerned an unsolicited letter from a third party which had been forwarded by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to the Refugee Review Tribunal. 484 In my respectful opinion neither Kioa v West nor VEAL is of direct relevance to the present case, which is not one of ""information"" of the kind referred to in them. The relevant information that ACCC ""possessed"" was that Telstra had implemented a churn process that required the participation of both the losing and gaining access seekers, and that neither Telstra (Bigpond) nor Request were participants in that process. This information came from Telstra or was at least known to Telstra. Furthermore, Telstra knew that ACCC's objective was to avoid disconnection charges in the case of an end-user switching service providers, and the information referred to was of obvious relevance to that objective. The procedural fairness issue raised in the present case concerns the solution arrived at and the reasoning process that led to it. This is a different area of discourse from that of information received by a decision-maker from a third party."

I need not set out those passages here. To those comments, only two matters need be added for emphasis, for the purposes of this case. First, provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court should be interpreted liberally and without imposing limitations not found in the express words: The 'Shin Kobe Maru' (HC) at 421. Secondly, a particular aspect of the importance of the context provided by the ALRC Report (otherwise discussed in The 'Cape Moreton' above) is the consideration referred to by the High Court in The 'Iran Amanat' at 138, as follows: The Australian legislation having been enacted against the background of English legislation and authority set out above, the definition of ""relevant person"" should be understood as having the same meaning as the courts had given to the corresponding words in the English statute. When the Parliament has enacted legislation, affecting the subject of international shipping, and followed a statutory precedent from overseas which has by then received a settled construction, there is every reason to construe the statutory language in the same way in this country unless such construction is unreasonable or inapplicable to Australian circumstances."

QUESTIONS OF LAW RAISED IN THE APPEAL 1.1 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in the methodology it adopted to ascertain whether the applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) accepted as a war related disease. 1.2 Was the Tribunal wrong in law by applying incorrectly or not at all sections 119 , 120 (1) and (3), 120A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) and the decision of Deledio v Repatriation Commission ? [This is a reference to the decision of the Full Court in Repatriation Commission v Deledio [1998] FCA 391 ; (1998) 83 FCR 82 in which (at 97-98) the Court explained a four step process to be followed by the Tribunal in determining whether the applicant has established a link between his or her operational service and a medical condition which is relied on to support the payment of a pension]. 1.3 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by reference to the statements of principle alone without regard to the expert clinical medical evidence of the psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant? 1.4 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in failing to apply or to apply correctly all relevant statements of principle for PTSD? 1.5 Was the Tribunal wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicant's claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear? 1.6 Was the Tribunal wrong in law by applying Mines v Repatriation Commission which contradicted the High Court Decisions of Bushell v Repatriation Commission, Byrnes v Repatriation Commission and Repatriation Commission v O'Brian; and the full Federal Court Decisions of Repatriation Commission v Whetton and Deledio and Repatriation Commission ? 1.7 Was the Tribunal wrong in law by failing to provide adequate and sufficient reasons for its findings on material questions of fact and a reference to the evidence or other material on which those findings were based? 3. GROUNDS OF APPEAL 3.1 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the methodology it adopted in ascertaining whether the Applicant was entitled to have the claimed condition of PTSD as a war related disease. 3.1.1 The Tribunal was required to determine first whether the applicant was suffering from PTSD before proceeding to determine if the disease was war service related. 3.1.2 The Tribunal conflated the two questions depriving the Applicant the benefit of the doubt in ascertaining whether he suffered a stressful event during his service. 3.1.3 The test adopted by the Tribunal throughout was that of the balance of probabilities whereas because of his operational service some of the circumstances surrounding the stressful events had to be given the more generous test of a reasonable hypothesis. 3.2 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the application of, or in the failure to apply sections 119 , 120 (1), (3), and 120A of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the decision of Deledio v Repatriation Commission . 3.2.1 These sections and the decision had application to determine the basis of a reasonable hypothesis whether the applicant had experienced a stressful event. The Tribunal erred in law in failing to apply the sections or the authority. 3.2.3 The Tribunal was required by law only to determine that the injuries claimed were not war caused if it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there were no sufficient grounds for making such a claim (s 120(1) to do so it had to raise the test of a reasonable hypothesis based on all the material before it (s 120(3)). This the Tribunal failed to do. 3.2.4 The Tribunal was wrong in law in requiring the applicant to provide objective evidence that he had encountered the bodies of the children whereas the Tribunal was required to determine whether there was a reasonable hypothesis pointed out by the material that he had encountered the bodies. The Tribunal, although rejecting the event as being neither truthful nor accurate, did not challenge it pursuant to the requirements of s 120(1) , namely disprove it beyond reasonable doubt. 3.2.5 The Tribunal failed to apply s 120(1) to the circumstances of the applicant's case. 3.2.6 It was insufficient for the Tribunal to note that the circumstances of mortar and rocket fire did not accord with official records and that the events were not mentioned to two psychiatrists and to conclude that these were not traumatic events experienced by the applicant. It was not appropriate for the Tribunal to prefer the accuracy to the old official records of the events in relation to the shooting event. The Tribunal was required to ascertain whether the Applicant had been exposed or confronted with a traumatic event regardless of the position of the body or whether or not he had entered the tent. 3.2.7 The Tribunal appears to confuse between what constituted a traumatic event and whether or not the event took place. The Tribunal conflates these two questions to the detriment of the applicant. 3.3 The Tribunal was wrong in law in determining the diagnosis of the condition of post traumatic stress disorder by reference to the statements of principle rather than the clinical evidence of psychiatrists who had interviewed the applicant. 3.3.1 Post traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed by both the psychiatrists commissioned by the Applicant (Dr Cole and Dr Holwill) and the Repatriation Commission psychiatrists (Dr Walton and Dr Gelb). The Tribunal failed to take into consideration these reports and the evidence given. 3.4 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the application of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder. 3.4.1 The Tribunal was required to determine the most favourable of the Statements of principle instead it used the more onerous. 3.4.2 The Tribunal was wrong in law in the standard of proof it adopted in determining whether the applicant met the requirements of the statements of principle for post traumatic stress disorder. 3.5 The Tribunal was wrong in law in failing to give adequate and proper consideration to the applicants claim for the condition of osteoarthrosis of the fingers of the right hand and in its determination that the right ear hearing problem was covered by the accepted disability of hearing loss of the left ear when there was a loss of hearing to the right side. 3.5.1 The Tribunal failed to provide clear reasons for rejection of osteoarthritis of the fingers of the right hand in which it needed to explain why, pursuant to s 120 of the Act , it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was not war caused. [The appellant did not press this ground insofar as it dealt with hearing loss]. 3.6 [This ground was not pressed]. 3.7 The Tribunal was wrong in law in failing to provide sufficient and adequate reasons for its decision. 3.7.1 The Tribunal was required to do so pursuant to section 43(2B) of the Administrative Appeals Act ."" 18 Once the Tribunal had concluded that the traumatic events described by Mr Masliczek had not occurred and that he was not suffering from PTSD there was no occasion for the Tribunal to embark on the four step process which is outlined Deledio in order to determine whether a non-existent medical condition could be linked to operational service. 19 Mr Masliczek submitted that it was not open to the Tribunal, having regard to the specialist medical evidence, to find that he did not suffer from PTSD. This submission must be rejected. Only one psychiatrist gave oral evidence. That was Dr Walton. Dr Walton made a diagnosis of PTSD on the basis of the bodies' event, the shooting event and the firing event as described by Mr Masliczek. He did not consider that the taxi event or the casualty event were stressful in the necessary sense. Drs Holwill, Cole and Gelb, whose reports were before the Tribunal, also diagnosed PTSD principally on the basis of the bodies' event. As the Tribunal found, this event did not occur. The fifth doctor, Dr Kenny, did not diagnose PTSD. The evidence did not, therefore, compel a finding that Mr Masliczek suffered from PTSD. 20 During oral argument counsel for Mr Masliczek sought to argue that the Tribunal had erred in the manner in which it dealt with the general anxiety and the depressive disorders which it found, in paragraph [36], that Mr Masliczek suffered. He argued that the Tribunal's reasons suggested that these conditions had been found not to be service related because Mr Masliczek had fallen at the third of the Deledio steps: he had not experienced a category 1A or a category 1B stressor as defined in Statements of Principles Nos 101 of 2007 and 27 of 2008. It was argued that, in accordance with the Full Court's decision in Repatriation Commission v Keeley [2000] FCA 532 ; (2000) 98 FCR 108 at 123; 131-2, the Tribunal was required to consider whether earlier versions of these instruments, which were in force at the time at which the primary decision on Mr Masliczek's claim was made, might, if applied, have led to a favourable decision. These earlier versions did not contain a requirement that an applicant must have experienced defined stressors during service. The Tribunal had not considered the earlier versions. 23 Grounds 3.5 deals with Mr Masliczek's claim that the osteoarthrosis of the fingers from which he suffers was service related. The Tribunal held that Mr Masliczek did ""not satisfy the first step"" which was identified in Deledio . 24 In Deledio the Full Court explained the first step as follows (at 97): ""1. The Tribunal must consider all the material which is before it and determine whether that material points to a hypothesis connecting the injury, disease or death with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by the person. No question of fact finding arises at this stage. If no such hypothesis arises, the application must fail."" 25 The Tribunal noted that Mr Masliczek had attributed his painful fingers to injuries sustained while playing volleyball in Vietnam. It noted the reports of medical examinations conducted shortly after he was discharged from the Army in 1968. Those reports did not detect any injuries to his hand. The Tribunal also considered Mr Masliczek's evidence. The Tribunal determined that ""the material does not point to a hypothesis connecting the condition with the circumstances of the particular service rendered by him."" This conclusion was open to the Tribunal. None of the material pointed to the necessary connecting hypothesis. 26 Ground 3.7, as developed in argument, directed attention to the way in which the Tribunal had explained (or failed to explain) its reasons relating to Mr Masliczek's general anxiety and depressive disorders and his osteoarthrosis. 30 Paragraph 42 of the Tribunal's reasons has already been examined above at [23] to [25]. The Tribunal has adopted some shorthand expressions such as ""the first step from Deledio "". Nonetheless its reasoning processes, as I have earlier summarised them, are sufficiently clear, in my opinion, to satisfy its obligations under s 43(2B) of the AAT Act . 31 The appeal should be dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice TRACEY.

Case13616,followed,Saraswati v Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1,"I cannot accept such a construction. It is true that s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) directs a court to prefer a construction promoting the purpose or object of an Act. It is also true that patent textual ambiguity is not required in order to consult purpose (ie reference to purpose may be had both to raise as well as to resolve ambiguity): Saraswati v Queen [1991] HCA 21 ; (1991) 172 CLR 1 , 22; see also Kowalski v Domestic Violence Crisis Centre Inc [2001] FCA 1082 ; (2001) 113 FCR 67 at [23] . 19 Nevertheless, the purposive approach to statutory construction is not a carte blanche licence to courts to depart from unambiguous plain meaning. While purpose may sometimes be used to add, subtract, or clarify words in a statute or regulation ( Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22), ... where the text of a legislative provision is grammatically capable of only one meaning and neither the context nor any purpose of the Act throws any real doubt on that meaning, the grammatical meaning is ""the ordinary meaning"" to be applied. A court cannot depart from ""the ordinary meaning"" of a legislative provision simply because that meaning produces anomalies[.] See also SZKTI v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 83 at [44] - [45] (noting that where a party contends that a provision should not be given its literal or plain meaning, such a contention may lack force absent a plausible competing construction). The only exception to this rule is where the ordinary meaning would lead not just to an anomaly, but to a result that is ""manifestly absurd"" or ""unreasonable"": Saraswati [1991] HCA 21 ; 172 CLR 1 at 22; see also Chiropedic Bedding Pty Ltd v Radburg Pty Ltd (2007) 74 IPR 398 at [23]. 43 As noted earlier, a review of the statutory context, legislative history, and legislative purpose reveals an attempt to balance two competing objects: (1) the need to reduce barriers to entry and competition and thus reduce costs of patent attorney services; while (2) maintaining strict professional qualification requirements and thus safeguarding the public interest in receiving only high quality services. This understanding of context and purpose does not throw doubt on the construction of reg 20.3(3)(a) such as required by the High Court in Saraswati to justify judicial amendment of a statute or regulation that departs from the ordinary meaning. The legislative and regulatory scheme has hit on a compromise whereby in-house corporate patent practice (which would tend to be focused much more on out-of-court matters such as patent drafting and prosecution), but not ordinary law firm practice (which would tend to focus more on the giving of advice with respect to court-related matters such as validity and infringement proceedings), satisfies the registration requirements. This is entirely consistent with a legislative objective of partial deregulation while ensuring that high standards are maintained with respect to the complex technical arena of patent drafting and prosecution."
Case23660,considered,Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10,"The manner in which s 153B is to be applied has been summarised as follows by Carr, Finn and Sundberg JJ in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2003] FCAFC 315: [20] The Court must first consider whether the sequestration order ought not to have been made. If it so finds, then the Court must consider whether, in the exercise of its discretion, the bankruptcy should be annulled: Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made. That is, the Court is entitled to consider not only the case as disclosed at the time when the sequestration order was made, but also those facts now known then to have existed. The Court excludes those facts which have occurred since the order was made. Later evidence of previously unknown facts may disclose matters which show that the sequestration order ought not to have been made: Re Frank; Ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396 ; Stankiewicz v Plata [2000] FCA 1185 at [19] ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23; Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347. These authorities, all of which were cited by the learned primary judge in his judgment, were accepted at first instance as reflecting the relevant law. The section thus contemplates two elements: the Court reaching a state of satisfaction that an order "" ought not to have been made "" and an exercise of discretion: Rigg v Baker [2006] FCAFC 179 at [59] , [2006] FCAFC 179 ; 155 FCR 531 at 543 per French J. 40 Moreover, s 153B confers a discretion -- even if the Court is satisfied that an order "" ought not to have been made "", there thereafter remains a discretion as to whether a bankruptcy should be annulled: cf Delph Sing v Wood [1918] HCA 69 , 25 CLR 497 at 498 9, 505 per Barton, Gavan Duffy and Rich JJ; Re Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10 at 23 per Gibbs J; Re Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420 at 421 per Gibbs J. Relevant to the exercise of that discretion is Ms Samootin's solvency. Such evidence as is before the Court shows that she remains insolvent. The further Affidavit as filed on 17 July 2008 does not lead to any different conclusion. If the occasion for the exercise of the discretion had arisen, it would have been exercised adversely to her."

Case17316,followed,William Brandt's Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co [1905] AC 454,"sale agreement did not dispose of or deal with any rights of old Boston to sue GE Capital for conduct in contravention of the Act. Whether or not rights to bring proceedings for damages under s 82 of the Act are assignable, in my opinion there is no reasonable prospect of success in new Boston's argument that the sale agreement effected a disposition of whatever rights old Boston had against GE Capital under the Act. Moreover, I do not think that, had the liquidator of old Boston sought to do so, new Boston could have prevented the liquidator enforcing old Boston's claims under the Act against GE Capital. Because of that, it seems to me that there is no reasonable prospect that it could be successfully argued by new Boston that an effective disposition of those rights had occurred. There was no communication from old Boston to GE Capital that assigned or made over whatever rights old Boston had in any respect, whether under the Act or in contract, to new Boston ( William Brandt's Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co [1905] AC 454 at 462). And, even though old Boston appears to have become deregistered, if the liquidator or creditors became aware that it had valuable rights against GE Capital, such as new Boston claims the rights it obtained under the sale agreement were, it is quite possible that steps might be taken to reregister old Boston to enable it to begin proceedings. I say all this because it seems to me to demonstrate the lack of efficacy of the basis upon which new Boston claims to assert old Boston's rights. I do not think that on the evidence before me there are reasonable prospects that such an argument could succeed. It may be countered that were old Boston reregistered, new Boston might be able to compel it to assign its rights in consequence of the provisions of the sale agreement. But no provision of the sale agreement offers reasonable prospects of success for new Boston to argue that it could compel the making over of old Boston's rights to sue under the Act. That agreement was silent on both that topic and the rights of old Boston to sue under that Act which were not part of the business the subject of the transfer. The damage which old Boston suffered, if any damage were suffered by the alleged contraventions, was a cause of action which appears, on any reasonably arguable construction of the sale agreement, to have been retained by old Boston. The sale agreement could not effect any assignment of the statutory causes of action to new Boston. It follows that GE Capital is entitled to have the claims against it under the Act dismissed on the basis that they have no reasonable prospect of being successfully prosecuted against it. No particular formality is required for an assignment for value to be valid and effective in equity. As Lord Macnaghten said in William Brandt's Sons Co v Dunlop Rubber Co [1905] AC 454 at 462: 'The language is immaterial if the meaning is plain. All that is necessary is that the debtor should be given to understand that the debt has been made over by the creditor to some third person.' As he continued, the real question is whether what is asserted to be an assignment is notice to the debtor that the assignee is 'interested in the money' ([1905] AC at 462). The letter sent by new, not old, Boston on 1 July 2005 in terms related future invoices to new Boston's ABN. It was silent about the payment of the debts due on any old invoices. But in any event, old Boston did not write the letter and so it gave no instruction to GE Capital. Whatever debt GE Capital may have owed old Boston on 1 July 2005 was never made over to new Boston. GE Capital could not have received a good discharge of any existing obligation to old Boston by paying new Boston, because old Boston never authorized GE Capital to do so."

Case6664,applied,Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 527 ; (1991) 105 ALR 115,"For the purposes of s 42Y(3)(b) , it may finally be noted, the Secretary does not maintain that there has been "" any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention "". But, as was pointed out by Olney J in Trade Practices Commission v ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 527 ; (1991) 105 ALR 115 in the context of pecuniary penalties being sought under s 76 of the Trade Practices Act for resale price maintenance, "" an absence of loss or damage is not a mitigating factor "". His Honour observed at 118 19: ... The Act also requires that regard be had to any loss or damage suffered as a result of the act or omission. In the facts of the present case there appears to be no basis upon which any loss or damage can be identified. Whatever may have been the circumstances that induced all other Victorian distributors to agree to maintain retail prices at the levels nominated by ICI, it is the conduct in relation to MRW and Heinrich O'Loughlin which is the subject of these proceedings. Nothing has been said to indicate that either of these companies, nor indeed any of their customers, suffered loss or damage by the attempt to induce them to maintain a minimum price. However, I do not think that the absence of loss or damage is necessarily a mitigating factor. In a case where the breach of the Act is an attempt to induce a reseller to impose a minimum price for goods supplied to the reseller, the question of loss or damage will rarely, if ever, arise. The Act does not distinguish in terms of culpability between the various types of conduct which constitute the practice of resale price maintenance. The same conclusion was also reached by Nicholson J in Australian Communications and Media Authority v Clarity1 Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1399 at [29] , [2006] FCA 1399 ; 155 FCR 377 at 384 when considering s 24(2) of the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) .

Case9888,cited,Re Tony Barlow Australia Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 1,"There is now a considerable body of case law on the nature of the discretion conferred by s 1322. In Re Wave Capital Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 418 French J indicated at paras 29 and 30 that: ""29. ... Like the discretion to validate invalid share issues under s 254E, the power conferred by s 1322 must be exercised having regard to the requirements of the purposes of the Corporations Act and any other relevant statutes whose application may be in issue. It must also be exercised having regard to the interests of all parties affected and the public interest in ensuring compliance with statute law and company constitutions. Evidence of a blatant disregard of the provisions of the Act or the constitution of the company may lead to refusal of relief: Re Onslow Salt Pty Ltd (2003) 198 ALR 344; 45 ACSR 322 and cases there cited. The provision is, however, remedial in character and should be given a liberal construction: Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 702 at 707, [27] per Lindgren J citing Re Australian Koyo Ltd (1984) 8 ACLR 928 at 930 and Elderslie Finance Corp Ltd v Australian Securities Commission (1993) 11 ACSR 157 at 160. 30. There is a constructional question whether the time limits for seeking quotations referred to in ss 723 and 724 are time limits which can be extended by the court under s 1322(4)(d). The power conferred by s 1322(4)(d) is to make an order 'extending the period for doing any act ... under the Act or in relation to a corporation'. Section 723(3) does not in terms impose an obligation to apply for quotation within 7 days after the date of the prospectus. Rather, it conditions the validity of the share issue or transfer in response to an application under the prospectus upon the application for quotation having been made within that time. I am satisfied, however, that the ordinary meaning of the words of s 1322(4)(d) can readily accommodate the extension of the period for making an application for quotation. The same is true in my opinion of the 7 day period referred to in s 724(1)(b). This accords with the approach taken by Lindgren J in Re Insurance Australia Group Ltd [2003] FCA 581 ; (2003) 45 ACSR 702 at 707, [28] where his Honour said: '[28] Courts have had no difficulty in treating s 1322(4)(d) as being available even though the ""period for doing any act, matter or thing or instituting or taking any proceeding under [the legislation] or in relation to a corporation"" in question did not form part of a provision which in terms imposed an absolute positive obligation to do the act, matter or thing or to institute or take the proceeding.' - citing Elderslie , above: Super John Pty Ltd v Futuris Rural Pty Ltd (1999) 32 CSR 398; 17 ACLC 1242; Pinnacle VRB Ltd v Reliable Power Inc [2001] VSC 262 ; (2001) 39 ACSR 8; 163 FLR 215; 19 ACLC 1450 and Brown v DML Resources Pty Ltd (in liq) (No 6) [2002] NSWSC 6 ; (2002) 40 ACSR 669; 166 FLR 393; 20 ACLC 537."" These observations have been repeated and acted upon in some number of decisions of this Court: see for example Re Tony Barlow Australia Ltd (2005) 53 ACSR 1 at pars 20 to 21; Re Biron Capital Ltd (2005) 54 ACSR 548 at par 14 ff. It is important to re-emphasise in this matter that as yet no shares have been issued pursuant to the prospectus. For that reason no question of invalidity as such arises at this stage, see s 254E(1) of the Act. Nonetheless, it is the case that extending time in a manner proposed in this application, that is up to and including 5 December 2007 (the date upon which the quotation application was in fact lodged with the ASX) will have the effect of depriving subscribers of a right that they would otherwise enjoy by virtue of the provisions of s 724(2) of the Act."

Case3053,discussed,VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471,"The Minister argued that for the obligation to provide particulars under s 424A(1) to be engaged, the Tribunal must consider that the information to which it refers is adverse to the applicant for review's claim to have the review decided in his or her favour and must be integral to the decision. The Minister relied on a line of authority in the Court, in particular the decision of Finn and Stone JJ in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 478 [33]. Moreover, the Minister submitted that to the extent that the Tribunal's reasons identified omissions in the claims made by the appellant in support of her application for a visa it was the omissions and nothing more which constituted the reason why, or the integral part of the reasoning why, the Tribunal came to reject the appellant's claim. In that respect the Minister relied upon what Finn and Stone JJ had earlier said in the VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 476-477 [24], namely: '[24] As to the first of these, there is now a considerable body of case law concerned with the compass of the term ""information"" in its s 424A(1) setting. The following propositions emerge from it: (i) the purpose of s 424A is to provide in part a statutory procedural analogue to the common law of procedural fairness: Paul v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1196 ; (2001) 113 FCR 396 at 429-30 [104] ; [2001] FCA 1196 ; 64 ALD 289 at 318. However the obligation imposed is not coextensive with that which might be imposed by the common law to avoid practical injustice: VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; BC200301782; (ii) the word ""information"" in s 424A(1) has the same meaning as ins 424: Win v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 56 ; (2001) 105 FCR 212 at 218 [20] ; and in this setting it refers to knowledge of relevant facts or circumstances communicated to or received by the tribunal: Tin v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1109 ; BC200004607 at [3]; irrespective of whether it is reliable or has a sound factual basis: Win, at 217-18 [19]-[22]; and (iii) the word does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations: Tin at [54]; Paul at FCR 428 [95]; ALD 317; Singh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1679 ; BC2000108482 at [25]; approved [2002] FCAFC 120 ; BC 200203793; nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc: WAGP of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 266 ; (2002) 124 FCR 276 at 282-4 [26] - [29] .' 20 The task of statutory construction obliges courts to construe a relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions in the statute as is pointed out by McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381 [69] . When s 424A refers to 'the reason or part of the reason' it does not divide the reasoning process into what is said to be 'integral' from what the Tribunal is required to express as its reasons in the language of s 430(1). In VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 478 [33] Finn and Stone JJ discussed the need to isolate what their Honours termed to be 'the integral parts of the reasons for the tribunal's decision'. Their Honours said that task, necessarily, was an interpretive one. 25 Moreover, there is a number of judgments in the Court in which conflicting views have been expressed as to whether the general proposition in VAF v Minister (2004) 206 ALR 471 at 447 lays down a rule of general application that identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps etc. can never amount to information. In SZECF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1200 at [21] , Allsop J pointed out there may be a distinction, sometimes fine, but nevertheless important, between information which may be knowledge acquired by the Tribunal and the subjective appraisal or thought processes of it. His Honour concluded (at [2005] FCA 1200 at [29] - [30] ): 'If, as here, the very form and content of a statement (including what was not said) is central to the rejection of virtually all of the evidence of the appellant, I do not see anything [Branson J said] in NIAH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2002] 124 FCA 223 at [28] as necessarily inconsistent with an application of s 424A. To say that there is no information here because the statement (which is information) lacked the aspect now being adduced would be to fail to recognize that the information that is central to the reason for the decision is that the appellant said so much and no more on an earlier occasion. That is the relevant information.'"
Case12465,discussed,Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works [1863] EngR 424 ; (1863) 14 CB(NS) 180,"follows from what I have held, that s 33V of the Federal Court of Australia Act does not apply to the application to discontinue. In the event that this conclusion is incorrect, both parties accepted that it was possible to grant leave for the proceedings to be discontinued and an appropriate order made protecting the rights of persons who were intended to be group members from the consequences of allowing that discontinuance. The sources of power to make those orders would be either ss 22 and 23 or (if I were wrong about the proceedings not being made under Pt IVA) ss 33V(2) , 33Z (1)(g) and s 33ZF of the Federal Court of Australia Act . Each of those sections is sufficient to enable the Court to make a declaration protecting the rights of third parties, being those whom the applicants sought to claim were group members. None of those third parties has been heard or joined. They have had no opportunity to protect their interests. Ordinarily (leaving aside cases or statutes excluding the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness) no-one should have his or her rights affected or destroyed without an opportunity of being heard. This principle was illustrated in the great case of Cooper v Wandsworth Board of Works [1863] EngR 424 ; (1863) 14 CB(NS) 180 [143 ER 414] and remains applicable today: Taylor v Taylor [1979] HCA 38 ; (1978) 143 CLR 1 ; Commissioner of Police v Tanos [1958] HCA 6 ; (1958) 98 CLR 383 at 395 per Dixon CJ and Webb J."

Case1532,cited,Ferdinands v Chief of Army [2003] FCAFC 10,"In his reasons for judgment, Ferdinands v Chief of Army [2008] FCA 1865 , Lander J refused to grant the extension of time sought because no proper explanation had been offered for the delay and because there was no prospect of Mr Ferdinands succeeding in obtaining an order setting aside the termination decision: at [41]. 4 Counsel for the respondents properly raised the question whether the decision of Lander J was an interlocutory decision or a final decision. If the latter, no leave to appeal from his decision was necessary. If the former, s 24(1A) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) provided that no appeal lay from that decision without leave. Leave to appeal may be given by a single judge: s 25(2)(a). Under O 52 r 10 of the Federal Court Rules leave to appeal is given in accordance with principles discussed in D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd &amp; Anor v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397 , in particular having regard to two main considerations, namely, whether in all the circumstances the decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration by the Full Court, and whether substantial injustice would result if leave to appeal were refused supposing the decision to be wrong. 6 I do not consider that decision dictates that the decision of Lander J in the present matter was a final order so that no leave to appeal is necessary. That is because this proceeding, unlike the proceeding in Paramasivam , did not seek to enforce an existing alleged cause of action which had become statute barred by the elapse of time. In other words, there was no claimed legal right which Mr Ferdinands was seeking to enforce. His application was for an extension of time within which to apply for an order to show cause why the termination decision should not be set aside. It was necessary for him, even had he applied for such an order within time, to satisfy a Justice of the High Court (or if the matter were remitted to this Court, a judge of this Court) that it was appropriate for an order to show cause to be issued. Moreover, as McHugh ACJ, Gummow and Heydon JJ said in Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 at [4] : the usual test for determining whether an order is final or interlocutory is whether the order, as made, finally determines the rights of the parties in a principal cause pending between them. That question is answered by determining whether the legal effect of the judgment is final or not. If the legal effect of the judgment is final, it is a final order; otherwise, it is an interlocutory order. (original emphasis, citations omitted) 8 Accordingly, I consider that Mr Ferdinands correctly approached the matter on the basis that he required leave to appeal from the decision of Lander J. 9 Mr Ferdinands made detailed written submissions about why leave to appeal should be granted. In essence, he said it was in the interests of justice to grant leave. He briefly developed them orally. However, his submissions really amounted to no more than a way of describing the nature of his claim. They did not pay sufficient attention to the particular circumstances. I invited him to indicate where he contended Lander J had fallen into error in his consideration of that application for an extension of time to apply for the order to show cause. In my view, Mr Ferdinands was unable to indicate any such error either in the description of the history relevant to consideration of that application, or in identifying the grounds advanced by Mr Ferdinands in support of it, or in his Honour's consideration of those grounds. I shall advert to them again shortly. 10 There are two additional matters which Mr Ferdinands raised, apparently for the first time on this application. The first is his assertion that Crennan J had no power to remit the matter to this Court for hearing and determination. He had not objected to the remittal order when it was made, nor had he raised that point before Lander J. He did not develop any argument in support of the proposition. It is plainly wrong: see s 44 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Secondly, he argued that the delegate of the Chief of Army had no power to terminate his employment in the way that had been done because ss 5 and 10 of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth) were ""involved"". Again, that matter had not been raised in his original application, nor before Lander J. No notice of that matter had been given to the respondents, other than in a generic way in his draft proposed notice of appeal exhibited to his affidavit sworn on 8 December 2008 where it is said that: That section 10 of the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 Application of the criminal code is declared invalid in law, and all associated subsections are declared invalid including section 162 , 163 and 165A . No detailed argument was developed in support of the contention. As it was not raised previously, it is unfair to the respondents to have been confronted with it only on this application, and more importantly, as it was not raised before Lander J, it cannot provide a basis for demonstrating that his Honour's reasoning was erroneous and that leave to appeal from it should be given. 11 I return to the matters which were argued before Lander J. 12 Mr Ferdinands orally suggested in a general way that the history recorded by Lander J, and the description of the matters or grounds upon which the application to show cause was made were misunderstood by his Honour. Closer questioning of Mr Ferdinands indicated that he did not identify any particular respect in which his Honour misunderstood either of those aspects of his claim. I will not refer to the detail of them. He was unable to demonstrate any arguable error in those respects. 13 It became apparent in the course of his oral submissions on this application, that the thrust of Mr Ferdinands' complaint is that he was wrongly convicted in the Adelaide Magistrates Court of assault, and wrongly convicted by a Defence Force Magistrate of a separate assault upon a service personnel. He argued that the delegate of the Chief of Army was wrong to have taken into account those convictions in deciding to terminate his employment. As Lander J said at [8] in essence, ""he seeks to use the proceeding to show cause to overturn those convictions"". Moreover, as Lander J pointed out at [38], the proposed proceeding is an attempt to quash the decision by a collateral attack upon the conviction by the Defence Force Magistrate. 14 Mr Ferdinands was convicted by a Defence Force Magistrate of one charge of assault upon an inferior officer on 4 November 1999. He belatedly sought to appeal from that decision on 17 April 2001. The President of the Defence Force Disciplinary Appeal Tribunal on 15 August 2001 refused to grant an extension of time to appeal. He appealed from that decision also. On 16 August 2002, that Tribunal extended the time for filing of an appeal but dismissed the appeal. Mr Ferdinands then appealed to this Court from that decision. That appeal was dismissed on 11 February 2003: Ferdinands v Chief of Army [2003] FCAFC 10. He applied to the High Court for special leave to appeal from that decision. That application was deemed to be abandoned for failure to comply with the High Court Rules on 1 October 2003. As Lander J said, his application for an extension of time to apply for an order to show cause should not be granted when it was, or to the extent that it was, seeking to make a collateral attack upon that conviction. 15 The fact that Mr Ferdinands was seeking collaterally to attack the Defence Force Magistrate's conviction was reinforced by his complaints about the conduct of that hearing, in particular that certain witnesses had not been called and certain documents had not been produced which he claimed ought to have been produced on that hearing. 16 Mr Ferdinands raised an additional point on this application for leave to appeal, apparently for the first time, that he could not have been terminated by a decision of the delegate of the Chief of Army because, following that conviction, the prosecuting officer had asked for the termination of his employment, but the Defence Force Magistrate had imposed a lesser penalty. Hence, he said, the Defence Force Magistrate had decided that termination of his employment as a member of the defence force was not an appropriate penalty for the conviction, and the Chief of Army could not then reach a different view or impose an additional penalty. The proposition oversimplifies the grounds upon which the decision to terminate his employment was made. The material before the Court indicates that the facts and circumstances relating to the reason for terminating his service were that conviction, a conviction for assault in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on 27 February 2001, together with evidence about Mr Ferdinands' character then provided relative to penalty in that Court, the termination of his civilian employment on 21 November 2001, and more generally his attitude towards others and towards authority. The evidence does not support Mr Ferdinands' assertion. As the point was not raised before Lander J, even if it were correct, it could not show arguable error at first instance. And the proposition, even if correct, inappropriately conflates the punishment imposed for an offence with the assessment of suitability to remain in particular employment. 17 Mr Ferdinands also criticised the approach of Lander J in deciding whether there was an adequate explanation for the delay in making the primary application. His Honour properly identified the principles, as discussed by McHugh J in Gallo v Dawson [1990] HCA 30 ; (1990) 93 ALR 479 at 480. In my view, nothing was identified to suggest that his Honour has misunderstood or misapplied them. He recognised the disadvantage applicable to Mr Ferdinands by reason of his impecuniosity and by reason of his need to be self-represented. 18 So far as I can determine, although not dealt with in the draft proposed notice of appeal, the only other matter advanced on this application for leave to appeal was an assertion that Lander J had incorrectly struck out an affidavit of Mr Ferdinands of 4 May 2007 as an abuse of process. His Honour ruled that he would not receive paras [1]-[35] of that affidavit, but received the remainder of that affidavit. It was entirely proper to have rejected those paragraphs of that affidavit. They did not relate to any issue relevant to the primary application. They contained a series of unrelated and offensive allegations against persons who were not parties to it. The balance of that affidavit comprises matters which his Honour regarded as potentially relevant to the application which he was considering. 19 I have therefore come to the view that Mr Ferdinands' application must be refused. He has not identified any matter in which Lander J might have fallen into error, even arguably so. He has not advanced any matter which specifically explains the delay between the making of the decision which he wishes to attack and the application for an extension of time to have made the application.

Case11454,cited,Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389,"In addition, I can be more comfortable in drawing an inference that the solicitors had actual authority by the failure of the Hume companies to call evidence. I am entitled to infer that the testimony would not have been favourable to Hume's case; Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418 419 (Handley JA). 47 The only other submission which I need to address under this subheading is not concerned with the question of authority. It is whether the email of 22 December 2006, attaching a copy of the letter of the same date, constituted written notice. 48 Counsel for Hume submitted it did not because an email is an electronic representation of writing and therefore does not constitute writing itself as required by Article 20(3).

IFT relies on the case of Friends of Hinchinbrook Society Inc. v The Minister for the Environment (No. 1) (1996) 69 FCR 1 for the proposition that it is appropriate to deny Gunns its costs in circumstances where it was joined to the proceeding as an interested person on its own application. In Friends of Hinchinbrook , Branson J imposed a condition on the joinder that the additional respondent not seek its costs in the proceeding.

Case16175,cited,Gordon v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 603,"Although s 51A does not prescribe a rate of interest, the usual practice in the Federal Court has been to adopt the rates of interest applied in the Supreme Court of the State in which the application is commenced unless there is evidence that the rates are penal or not commercial: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 688 at [7] , Gordon v Commonwealth [2008] FCA 603. The current rate of interest prescribed under s 47 Supreme Court Act 1995 (Qld) is 10% per annum. No submissions were made by the parties as to an appropriate rate of interest. I consider that the rate of interest of 10% per annum under the Supreme Court Act should be applied."
Case14747,cited,Review Australia Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1009 ,"The plaintiff must, however, show that it has an arguable case against the proposed defendant to the standard or being able to resist an application for summary judgment by the proposed respondent had that proposed party been sued in separate proceedings: Review Australia Pty Ltd v Redberry Enterprise Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1009 at [5] . 7 I have read the affidavits of the several investors together with the affidavits of Mr Jones, to which I have referred. The evidence which establishes at least an arguable case includes relevantly: (a) The existence, at all material times, of the relevant companies, namely: (i) the proposed eighth defendant; and (ii) Firepower Holdings Group Limited. (b) The issue of shares in Firepower to Green Triton on 2 June 2005. (c) The absence at all material times of a prospectus, profile statement or offer information statement lodged with the plaintiff in relation to any offer of shares in Firepower: s 727(1). (d) The fact that the shares that were the subject of the alleged contravening offers made by the eighth defendant were among those issued to it on 2 June 2005. (e) The purpose of the issue of the shares to Green Triton was the sale or transfer of the shares: s 707(3), which is to be inferred on the basis of s 707(4) from the sales of shares by Green Triton that are described in the affidavits of Geoffrey Allan, Carol Ashworth, Darryl Edmondson and Nicholas Furlan, and from the transcript of Timothy Francis Johnston on 4 March 2008. In the transcript, Mr Johnston is recorded to say that, in effect, the eighth defendant was (among other things) to bring funds into Firepower through the sale of shares. (f) The alleged contravening offers were made by the first defendant, Axis International Management Pty Ltd as agent on behalf of the eighth defendant. (g) The fact that those offers were made on behalf of the eighth defendant, is referred to in the transcript of the examination of Timothy Francis Johnston on 5 March 2008. In the transcript, Mr Johnston is recorded to say that, in effect, the sixth defendant, Quentin Ward, in his position with the first defendant, had authority to make the offers shown in the share register on behalf of the eighth defendant. (h) The absence of the exemptions set out in ss 708 and 708A: see s 707(3). The exemptions that are potentially relevant for the purpose of this application are those set out in ss 708(8) (sophisticated investors); 708(10) (offer through financial advisers); 708(11) (professional investors - to be read together with the definition of that term in section 9); 708(12) (offers to person associated with Firepower) and 708A(5), (11) and (12) (certain offers of quoted securities). The Investor Affidavits establish, to the requisite degree of proof, the absence of the exemptions found in s 708. Section 708A does not apply because Firepower has never been listed. 8 In the current proceedings Green Triton should be joined as the eighth defendant, in my opinion, as it is a party necessary to ensure that all matters in dispute in the proceeding may be effectually and completely determined and adjudicated upon and, furthermore, ought to have been joined and indeed would have been joined save for the fact that it was thought to have been deregistered at the time proceedings commenced. I will accordingly make an order in terms of para 1 of the motion."
Case12496,referred to,Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243,"Mr Grigor-Scott's case has failed moreover to confront and answer the nature and the extent of the findings and reasoning of this Court in Jones v Toben , both at first instance and on appeal, to which authority I have of course earlier made reference. There was ample corresponding support in the present case for the making here of similar findings to those made in Jones v Toben . Moreover it is unnecessary for me to determine the validity of the second respondent's assertions regarding the Holocaust. Hely J observed in Jones v Scully [2002] FCA 1080 ; (2002) 120 FCR 243 at [176] - [177] as follows: '176. I am not in a position to determine, as a matter of fact, whether the claim made by the author of the pamphlet that the Holocaust never occurred is true or not. I do not have the evidence which would be needed to enable me to make that determination, assuming that the matter is susceptible of proof in a court. As Gray J observed in Irving v Penguin Books Ltd [2000] EWHC QB 115 at [1.3] , that is a task for historians whose role it is to provide an accurate narrative of past events; whereas my role is to determine whether the public dissemination of the leaflet by Mrs Scully in Launceston contravenes s 18C of the RDA. 177. In my view, a leaflet that conveys an imputation that Jews are fraudulent, liars, immoral, deceitful and part of a conspiracy to defraud the world is reasonably likely to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate Jews in Australia. This would be so regardless of whether or not the leaflet made mention of the Holocaust. However, the fact that the imputation arises in the context of a debate about the Holocaust makes it even more likely that the leaflet would cause offence. This is particularly so owing to the inflammatory language used in the leaflet, as well as the fact that it is unambiguously dismissive of the Jewish view of the Holocaust. I therefore find that this leaflet contravenes s 18C.' I think it is appropriate for me to refrain from addressing further what appears in the evidence as to Mr Grigor-Scott's apparent views concerning the occurrence or otherwise of the Holocaust. 65 In the result the application by Mr Jones made on his own part and on behalf of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry should be granted, and the relief sought thereby should be ordered in principle. Given however that the BBC does not have legal personality, not being an incorporated entity as I have earlier explained, no order may be made against what is merely a name or description, though of course restraints may be made against future conduct of Mr Grigor-Scott as to causing or committing proscribed conduct to occur, including proscribed conduct undertaken in the name of the BBC. I should add that the applicant's amended application sought inter alia an order that the second respondent, Mr Grigor-Scott, deliver to the applicant a written statement of apology. I consider such an order to be inappropriate. I refer in that regard to the observation of Branson J in Jones v Toben (2002) 71 ALD 629 at [106], where her Honour stated as follows: '...I do not consider it appropriate to seek to compel the respondent to articulate a sentiment that he plainly enough does not feel. As Hely J pointed out in Jones v Scully at [245] , ""prima facie the idea of ordering someone to make an apology is a contradiction in terms""...' The second respondent must pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings, including any previously reserved costs. I certify that the preceding sixty-five (65) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Conti.

See Re Luck [2003] HCA 70 ; (2003) 203 ALR 1 and Rana v University of South Australia [2004] FCA 559 ; (2004) 136 FCR 344 , as cited in SZKCV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1201 per Jessup J at [3]. The test whether an order is interlocutory or final is whether the order made finally determines the legal rights of the parties in the principal proceeding before the Court: Bienstein v Bienstein [2003] HCA 7 ; (2003) 195 ALR 225. Regard must be had to the legal, as distinct from the practical, effect of the judgment: SZDGN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] FCA 1543 at [3] per Lindgren J. It is clear, in my view, that Scarlett FM's decision to dismiss the application on the basis that it disclosed no arguable case for the relief sought must be regarded, as the authorities stand, as interlocutory."
Case14177,cited,Maritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 113 IR 326,"As indicated above, I have concluded that each of Mr McGill and Mr O'Connell was refused approval to take leave on 15 November 2005 because he proposed to attend the Day of Protest. I also accept that a threat was made to dock Mr McAninly's pay for the time that he spent at the Day of Protest because he attended the Day of Protest. However, despite the link discussed above between attendance at the Day of Protest and membership of an industrial association, I am satisfied that the relevant determinations made by officers of ACS, ATO, DVA and DEST respectively were not made because employees affected by the determinations were members of an industrial association. Rather the evidence shows that the immediate or operative reason for the determinations was the circulation of the DEWR Advice ( Maritime Union of Australia v CSL Australia Pty Ltd (2002) 113 IR 326 at [54]). The determinations were a direct consequence of the contravention of s 298K(1) that resulted from the circulation of the DEWR Advice. They illustrate how the DEWR Advice altered the position of Commonwealth employees who were members of CPSU to the employees' prejudice. The officers concerned felt obliged to ensure that their respective agencies complied with the DEWR Advice."
Case650,cited,Millar &amp; Lang Ltd v Polak [1908] 1 Ch 433,"Certainly for something to be a ""drawing"" for copyright purposes no great complexity or (as the statute tells us) artistic quality is required.

""Good luck"", ""Lest we forget"", and ""For old times sake"" in a distinctive form within an ornamental oval or circular scroll. In Roland Corporation v Lorenzo &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (1991) 33 FCR 111 the devices held by Pincus J to be drawings were based on the letters R and B but, as is apparent from the report at 112, were quite stylised. As his Honour said at 114, they were ""by no means random and were plainly drawn with care, to obtain an effect"". Clearly a letter or letters of the alphabet can provide the subject matter for a drawing. One thinks of the illuminated manuscripts of medieval works such as the Book of Kells. However, in the present case the text is fulfilling a semiotic function. It is communicating to the reader the message that within the cardboard box will be found a wooden photo box with 6 albums which hold 120 10 x 15 cm photos. The pictorial image of that box is conveyed by a photograph, which is not a drawing."

A court should not be too ready to disallow costs simply because a party has failed upon an issue, unless it be quite a separate and distinct issue from the issues in respect of which it succeeded or unless there be some element of unreasonableness or inappropriate conduct in relation to that issue: cf Verna Trading Pty Ltd v New India Assurance Pty Ltd [1991] 1 VR 129 at 152-154."""
Case9443,discussed,Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth of Australia [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129,"reason was identified as to why the cross demand could not have been set up in the defamation action. Even if it is appropriate to attribute to the applicant the statement of the applicant's husband that he was not advised that he could bring a cross demand, such a reason is not sufficient to show that the cross demand could not have been set up in the defamation action. In Re Ling; Ex parte Ling v Commonwealth of Australia [1995] FCA 1410 ; (1995) 58 FCR 129 , Hill J said (at 132): ""What emerges here is that the practical reason why no action was taken against the Commonwealth, whether by the institution of a cross-claim or otherwise, is that the debtor was not advised that he could do so. But that does not suffice to make the claim one which the debtor could not have set up in the Commonwealth proceedings. That is not a question to be determined by reference to practicalities; it is a question to be answered by reference to legal considerations: Re Brink; Ex parte Commercial Banking Co of Sydney Ltd [1980] FCA 78 ; (1980) 44 FLR 135 ; Re James; Ex parte Carter Holt Harvey Roofing (Australia) Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 183 ; Walton v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd [1994] FCA 1114 ; (1994) 49 FCR 406 at 408; Re Scott; Ex parte Scott v Beneficial Finance Corporation Ltd [1994] FCA 1379 ; (1994) 53 FCR 324 ; Re Martinovic (unreported, Federal Court, Kiefel J, 23 June 1995). Thus the mere fact that there was an excuse as to why the cross-claim was not brought will not avail a debtor seeking to come within s 41(7) of the Act, if a cross-claim could legally have been brought."" I accept the respondent's fourth submission. I am not satisfied that a cross demand in relation to the first publication could not have been set up in the defamation action. Second publication The USFA published a bulletin to the Ukrainian community throughout Australia, including South Australia. In Volume 15, July-September 2002, there was an article which referred to the applicant in defamatory terms. The evidence of the applicant's husband as to the respondent's involvement in the publication was as follows: ""I refer to the affidavit of Mr Whittaker of 22 December 2008 and to the exhibit thereto, namely a translation of the USFA Bulletin 15 of July September 2002. The USFA bulletin was published throughout Australia to the Ukrainian community including in South Australia. I have been informed by my wife whom I verily believe that she was told by the then chairman of the USFA Mr Jurko Suchowerskyj, who took over that position when Dr Motyka was not re-elected that Dr Motyka was the author of the defamatory statements about me contained in it.

The respondents cited Desktop and Autodesk Inc v Dyason [1992] HCA 2 ; (1992) 173 CLR 330 in support of the proposition that there could be no originality in a work that derived ""from other copyright sources without permission (or acknowledgement)"". This was, so they said, due to a lack of originality. These two cases concerned copyright in factual information and, accordingly, are not directly in point in the present case. In any event, I would reject the respondents' basic submission on two bases. First, I accept that, as the applicants submitted, it would be a question of fact in each case as to whether the applicants had infringed copyright in any particular pre-existing work. Secondly, even if copyright in a pre-existing work was infringed, the proposition for which the respondents contend is unsupported by the authorities and authors learned in the field of copyright."

They will survive the execution and delivery of any assignment or other document entered into for the purpose of implementing any transaction.' In that context it was said by the Commissioner that labelling the contractual rights and obligations of each party as 'personal' did not conclude the issue, and that whether contractual rights 'are truly to be seen as ""personal"" is a question of construction in all the circumstances', citing in that regard well-known authority. I was also referred to the observations of Gummow J (as a member of a Full Federal Court) in Hepples v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1990) 22 FCR 1. In relation to the operation of the statutory definition of asset , his Honour observed (at 27): 'In my view, rights which are not proprietary in character... whether because they are personal rights or because they are ""rights"" merely in some popular sense, are not ""assets"" within the meaning of s 160A of the Act.'

Speaking generally, there will be an allotment when there is a binding contract to issue and take shares and an appropriation of shares, usually by the directors, to the intending member: Commonwealth Homes and Investment Company Limited v Smith [1937] HCA 73 ; (1937) 59 CLR 443 at 461, Dixon J; Central Piggery Co Ltd v McNicoll and Hurst [1949] HCA 19 ; (1949) 78 CLR 594 at 599 per Dixon J, quoting Spitzel v Chinese Corporation (1899) 80 LT 347 at 351 per Stirling J; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Helens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 4 ; (1981) 146 CLR 336 at 371 per Mason J.

Case10891,referred to,Dart Industries Inc v D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101,"An account of profits is an alternative remedy to damages: see Patents Act 1990 , s 122(1). Its purpose is not to compensate the patentee, nor to punish the infringer, but rather to prevent the unjust enrichment of the infringer at the expense of the patentee: Dart Industries Inc v D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 54 ; (1993) 179 CLR 101 at 110-111. By reference to the judgment in Dart v D&eacute;cor [1993] HCA 54 ; 179 CLR 101 and the cases there cited, I have approached the calculation of the account of profits in this case on the following basis. The infringers should account for the actual profit that they have gained from the infringement. In calculating those profits, it is appropriate to deduct costs directly attributable to selling and delivering infringing articles from the revenue made from such sales and deliveries. It may be appropriate to deduct a proportion of general overhead costs such as plant, equipment and managerial costs. The deduction of such costs depends upon their being shown to have been attributable to the sales, the onus for which demonstration is upon the infringers. The account of profits is a discretionary remedy and the Court may decline to grant the remedy in respect of profits made by the infringer during the period in which it was unaware of the applicant's rights. In this latter respect, see in particular Colbeam Palmer v Stock Affiliates Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 50 ; (1968) 122 CLR 25 at 33-36 and the Patents Act 1990 , s 123 which is in the following terms: (1) A court may refuse to award damages, or to make an order for an account of profits, in respect of an infringement of a patent if the defendant satisfies the court that, at the date of the infringement, the defendant was not aware, and had no reason to believe, that a patent for the invention existed. (2) If patented products, marked so as to indicate that they are patented in Australia, were sold or used in the patent area to a substantial extent before the date of the infringement, the defendant is to be taken to have been aware of the existence of the patent unless the contrary is established. (3) Nothing in this section affects a court's power to grant relief by way of an injunction."

The method by which the moneys to be paid under the limited recourse loan agreements were paid by the lender and then in turn paid to the manager was known to the members of the CECK partnership because they endorsed the bills of exchange. Even if it was unknown, as might have been the case with the applicants involved in the TVA Project because the bills of exchange were endorsed by Plutora as duly appointed agent and attorney of Civil and Earth, the method of payment is still a matter to be taken into account.

Case16321,referred to,KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354,"When applying these principles, the Court must balance the need for the expeditious conduct of litigation, particularly in a court committed to a case management system, and the ""the strong reluctance of courts to prevent litigants having a proper opportunity to present their cases"": KM &amp; A Chadwick Pty Ltd v Yeung [1995] FCA 354 per Tamberlin J. Ms Wu's motion must also be considered in light of the other powers of the Court to sanction non-compliance, such as the use of costs orders. 52 The history of this matter is troubling. The first and second respondents have been in default numerous times in the course of this proceeding. They filed their first lists of discoverable documents on 18 February 2004, over three months after the original deadline and over a month after orders by consent that they be filed by 15 January 2004. Moreover, these lists were filed only after Ms Wu brought two motions for compliance. Subsequent to this, Ms Wu has been required to take extraordinary steps to secure inspection of documents. 53 In addition, it is clear that Ms Wu has been frustrated by other action, or inaction, by these respondents, even if not amounting to non-compliance with court orders. The application for substituted service, the initial failure to seek to have a subpoena issued to Mr Guss, the failure of the respondents personally to attend mediation, the resignation of Barry Armitage from office in Avin, and the frequent changes in legal representation are matters that have undoubtedly caused Ms Wu vexation and have made the conduct of litigation more difficult than it would otherwise have been. Having regard to their conduct, I find that the first and second respondents have failed to defend the proceeding with due diligence. They are therefore in default for the purposes of O 35A r 2(2)(h) of the Rules."
Case12198,cited,Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (2003) 198 ALR 315,"On 4 December 2003, after a contested hearing in the above proceedings, I ordered that the present applicant, Mr Kemp, be joined as a party to each of the proceedings (see Davis-Hurst v Minister for Land and Water Conservation (NSW) (2003) 198 ALR 315). I did so in reliance on unchallenged evidence which tended to establish that Mr Kemp is a descendant of the Pirripaayi people who are traditionally associated by Aboriginal law and custom with an area which includes the Saltwater land. 3 In Davis-Hurst at [14]-[15] I observed: 'It is apparently because of resource implications that Mr Kemp does not wish to advance a claim for a determination of native title in respect of Saltwater, either on his own behalf, or on behalf of himself and other living descendents of the Pirripaayi people. However, he is concerned that a determination in favour of the applicant would give formal recognition to a version of history that does not recognise the Pirripaayi people as the traditional owners of Saltwater. Mr Kemp's concern is not alleviated by the possibility that there may be extensive, or even complete, overlaps between the present claimant group and the living descendants of the Pirripaayi people. Mr Kemp is further concerned, as I understand him, that it is possible, or even likely, that the applicant is the wrong person to represent the claimant group, however described, in these proceedings. Mr Kemp believes, on the basis of information which he has obtained from Mr Marr, that under traditional Aboriginal law and custom a woman cannot claim the areas of land the subject of the applications. He also believes, apparently on the same basis, that the applicant may not accept, or perhaps be aware of, the correct dreaming story and the customary laws of the area in question. As is mentioned above, his belief is that the applicant accepts a version of the history of the claim areas that fails to give proper recognition to the connection of the Pirripaayi people to Saltwater.' 4 I noted at [19] that Mr Kemp's evidence disclosed two underlying concerns. First, a concern that Dr Davis-Hurst and the Kattang people of the Manning Valley are not the group who hold the common or group rights comprising the native title in the Saltwater land. Secondly, a concern as to the identity of the traditional laws and customs under which that native title is held. 5 In Davis-Hurst at [27] I concluded that Mr Kemp, as a descendant of the Pirripaayi people, had standing to oppose the making of the determinations of native title sought by Dr Davis-Hurst. No appeal was instituted against the order made on 4 June 2003 joining Mr Kemp as a respondent to the applications for determinations of native title in the Saltwater land. 6 On 11 August 2005 the second respondent, the Minister for Lands for the State of New South Wales, applied to the Registrar of the National Native Title Tribunal pursuant to s 24CG of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) ('the Act') for the registration of an indigenous land use agreement ('the Agreement') in respect of the Saltwater land. Mr Kemp is not a party to the Agreement. The parties to the Agreement are the second to seventh respondents to this proceeding; that is, two Ministers of State for New South Wales, the Director-General of a New South Wales government department, the local government body for the relevant area, Dr Davis-Hurst and an entity described in the recitals to the Agreement as having been incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Association Act 1976 (Cth) for the purpose of holding native title in trust for the Saltwater People. 7 The recitals to the Agreement refer to the proceedings in this Court for determinations of native title in respect of the Saltwater land. They then record: 'D. The State on the basis of evidence provided by the Registered Native Title Claimant is prepared to recognise that the Saltwater People hold native title rights and interests in the Saltwater National Park and part of the Khappinghat Nature Reserve. E. The Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement for the purpose of: (a) recognising that the Applicant and the Saltwater People hold native title in the land and waters concerned; (b) regulating the exercise by the Saltwater People and the Saltwater Tribal Council of the native title rights and interests in the Agreement Area; (c) providing for a role for the Saltwater Tribal Council in the future management of the Saltwater National Park and part of the Khappinghat Nature Reserve. (d) providing for the withdrawal of native title determination applications NC95/4 (NG6013/98) and NC95/5 (NG6014/98); and (e) settling other matters between the Parties. F. The Greater Taree City Council, the land manager of the former Saltwater Reserve, agrees with and supports the making of this Agreement to resolve native title applications NC95/4 (NG6013/98) and NC95/5 (NG6014/98).'"
Case12049,distinguished,Saffron v Societe Miniere Cafrika [1958] HCA 50 ; (1958) 100 CLR 231,"seems from the learned Federal Magistrate's reasons for judgment that, in the course of oral submissions, the Appellant also advanced a case, which was not revealed by the grounds of judicial review that it had specified, that the Tribunal had erred by failing to consider whether each of the ""main businesses"" was a ""qualifying business"". The learned Federal Magistrate noted (reasons for judgment, para 51) that neither party had put before the Tribunal matters relevant to establishing a ""qualifying business"" which was a subject ""taken as said"". His Honour then opined (reasons for judgment, para 52), by reference to Saffron v Societe Miniere Cafrika [1958] HCA 50 ; (1958) 100 CLR 231 ( Saffron's Case ), ""The matter never having been put in issue before this time cannot now be raised"". On the appeal to this Court, the Appellant's submission was that the Tribunal had erred because it did not properly turn its mind to the question of whether the two businesses specified on the visa application form were ""qualifying businesses"" as defined by reg 1.03 of the Regulations. It was submitted that only by so doing could the Tribunal properly have determined that those businesses were separate ""main businesses"" for the purposes of reg 1.1(2) of the Regulations. From this it was said to follow that the rejection of United's business as a ""main business"" was erroneous because it did not violate the regulatory prohibition against the nomination of more than two ""main businesses"". In turn, the learned Federal Magistrate was said to have fallen into error by failing to hold that the identified alleged error on the part of the Tribunal was jurisdictional. The learned Federal Magistrate was also submitted erroneously to have concluded that, because the question of whether the originally specified main businesses were qualifying businesses had not been raised before the Tribunal, it could not be raised as a jurisdictional error ground before the Federal Magistrates Court. The Appellant submitted that ""the failure of the Tribunal to even turn its mind to the question of whether the main businesses nominated on the visa application form were 'qualifying businesses', was a fundamental failure to understand the task before it"". The Appellant contended that the reference by the learned Magistrate to Saffron 's Case was inapt. With respect, I agree."
Case20789,cited,Australian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts (1986) 12 FCR 395,"Australian Telecommunications Commission v Colpitts (1986) 12 FCR 395 , the Full Court found that an appeal from the decision of the Australian Telecommunications Commission was competent in the following circumstances. The decision was that the employee should be compulsorily retired for medical unfitness under s 56 of the Telecommunications Act 1975 (Cth). As required by s 56 , the Telecommunications Regulations 1975 (Cth) made provision for review of such a decision. The Review Tribunal decided that ""there was insufficient evidence to recommend any alternative to the decision"". The employee successfully challenged the validity of the decision of the Review Tribunal under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975 (Cth), including on the basis that the relevant regulations did not make proper provision for review of the initial decision so the initial decision under s 56 was itself invalid. The judge at first instance delivered reasons for judgment to that effect, and, although no formal judgment was entered, both in his reasons for judgment and by a minute of orders containing proposed orders accompanying them made declarations as to the invalidity of the decision to retire the employee and setting aside that decision. The primary judge also concluded that, in any event, the Review Tribunal had failed to accord the employee procedural fairness so that, but for the decision about the invalidity of the relevant regulations, the matter would have had to be remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconciliation. The Full Court regarded the appeal from the order setting aside the initial decision as competent, even though there was no challenge to its being set aside for breach of procedural fairness. That is, the appeal was regarded as competent even though it was accepted by the employer as appellant that the Review Tribunal decision should be set aside because procedural fairness was not given to the employee. Toohey J (with whom Fisher J agreed) said at 402-3 that the appeal was ""from a finding implicit in the judgment"" that the initial decision was also invalid because it must have been on that basis that the matter was not remitted to the Review Tribunal for reconsideration, but that the decisions were declared to be invalid."
Case7635,cited,Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1177 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 601,"In Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [2002] NSWSC 1177 ; (2002) 43 ACSR 601 , Barrett J approved a scheme subject to alterations which his Honour described as ""peripheral"" (at [21]). His Honour stated that the scheme in respect of which approval was sought differed in certain respects from the form of scheme that had been sent to members in accordance with the orders of the court previously made. Barrett J added (at [21]): It is clear, however, that the changes or differences are of a minor and technical kind and that their effect is to improve the smooth working of the scheme. 16 I do not purport to define or circumscribe the circumstances in which the Court may properly exercise the discretion to approve subject to alterations. The circumstances in which the Court may be asked to exercise the power vary. For example, the purpose may be to overcome minor technical errors or oversights present in the scheme as agreed to by the shareholders (see, for example, Re H Craig Pty Ltd ); to bring the scheme as agreed to by them into line with the explanatory statement that was sent to them (see, for example, Re Permanent Trustee Co Ltd ); or to protect creditors (see, for example, Re Evandale Estates Ltd ). The alterations may be suggested by the plaintiff or by the Court. Apparently, however, the plaintiff would be entitled, if faced with alterations on which the Court insisted but to which it did not agree, to withdraw its application for approval."
Case2175,considered,Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441,"In other words, one can look to the circumstances in which the subject entity was formed and the manner in which it is fulfilling the purposes for which it was incorporated, but there remains the issue of whether one can examine the subjective motives and intentions of the promoters of the subject entity and its directors for the purpose of ascertaining if the statutory exemption from income tax operates. In Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club 23 FCR at 98, Lockhart J referred to this issue by reference to the decision of the High Court in Brookton Co-operative Society Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1981] HCA 28 ; (1981) 147 CLR 441 where the ultimate issue was whether the taxpayer was a co-operative company within the meaning of s 117 of the ITAA 1936. One of the elements of the statutory definition was that the company 'is established for the purpose of carrying on any business having as its primary object or objects one or more of the following ... [objects]'. 211 The diversity of opinion in Brookton had previously been commented on by Ormiston J of the Supreme Court of Victoria in SSAU Nominees Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1985) 16 ATR 992 at 1011: 'Here it is clear that all members of the court on each occasion [Brookton and Ruffy] held the view that the primary object or objects of the appellant's business could not be determined solely, or even initially, by reference to its memorandum of association, and that evidence of its history, setting up and activities, had to be examined. In this instance Mason J (at 453), with the concurrence of Wilson J, thought that the intentions, if not the motives, of the promoters could be looked at, although Aickin J strongly disagreed: at 463.'"
Case23774,referred to,Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78,"Section 75(1) obliges the Minister to decide whether an action is a controlled action and, if it is, which provisions of Part 3 are the controlling provisions. The applicant rightly points out that the language of s 75 requires the Minister to recognise his jurisdiction and that it does not follow that the Minister is to determine the issue subjectively. It is relevant that s 75 contains no reference to the Minister's mental state by the use of words such as ""opinion"", ""belief"" or ""satisfaction"" which often signify that the decision is not a jurisdictional fact. While the presence of such terms would almost invariably indicate that the determination of fact is not jurisdictional (see for instance, Vanmeld Pty Ltd v Fairfield City Council [1999] NSWCA 6 ; (1999) 46 NSWLR 78 at 90-91), their absence is not decisive; see Timbarra at 64. See also Beyazkilinc v Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre [2006] FCA 1368 ; (2006) 155 FCR 465 at 475-8 per Besanko J."
Case18471,cited,University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601,"Pakula Tackle website has the hall marks of a trade catalogue. So too does that of Zacatak. A trade catalogue can constitute an original literary work; University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 608. In A One Accessory Imports Pty Ltd v Off Road Imports Pty Ltd (1996) 65 FCR 478 at 487, Drummond J stated: Copyright subsists in an ""original literary work"": s 32 of the Act. The expression ""literary work"" is defined in s 10 to include: ""a table, or compilation, expressed in words, figures or symbols ... "". Trade catalogues are capable of constituting original literary works: University of London Press Ltd v University Tutorial Press Ltd [1916] 2 Ch 601 at 608; Purefoy Engineering Co Ltd v Sykes Boxall &amp; Co Ltd (1955) 72 RPC 89 at 95. The cases repeatedly say that whether a compilation has sufficient originality to attract copyright protection depends on the degree of skill, judgment or labour which has been involved in producing it. See Ladbroke (Football) Ltd v William Hill (Football) Ltd [1964] 1 WLR 273; [1964] 1 All ER 465; Football League Ltd v Littlewoods Pools Ltd [1959] Ch 637 at 650-651; Blackie &amp; Sons Ltd v Lothian Book Publishing Co Pty Ltd [1921] HCA 27 ; (1921) 29 CLR 396 at 398-399; Real Estate Institute of New South Wales v Wood (1923) 23 SR (NSW) 349 at 352. So far as compilations that consist entirely of existing material, that is, material not created by the compiler, are concerned, Ladbroke (Football) Ltd is authority that originality may be found, and a claim of copyright may therefore subsist, by virtue of selection alone. See at 277-278; 469-470, per Lord Reid, at 286-287; 476-477 per Lord Hodson, at 289-290; 478-479 per Lord Devlin and at 292, 293; 480, 481 per Lord Pearce. In Collis v Cater, Stoffell &amp; Fortt Ltd (1898) 78 LT 613, a decision that has ""never been doubted"" ( Ladbroke (Football) Ltd at 290; 479) copyright was held to exist in a chemist's catalogue ""although it contained `nothing whatever but a simple list' of drugs, etc with names and prices which the plaintiff kept in stock or could obtain to order"": Ladbroke (Football) Ltd at 278; 470. That copyright can exist in such a mundane compilation of information readily available to all shows why the skill, judgment and labour in selecting what to include in a trade catalogue will be as relevant as the often very limited skill, judgment and labour involved in putting that selection into written form, in determining whether the compilation has sufficient ""originality"" to attract copyright. In considering whether a compilation that wholly consists of or that includes existing material is itself an original work, the question is whether the compilation, looked at as an entity, is original: it is not proper to dissect the work into its parts, and by determining that the individual parts lack originality, to deny originality to the whole work. This issue is dealt with fully in Ladbroke (Football) Ltd . The reason is that by s 32 of the Act, ""copyright is a statutory right which ... would appear to subsist, if at all, in the literary or other work as one entity"", per Lord Hodson at 285; 475. See also Ladbroke (Football) Ltd at 276-277, 290 and 291; 468-469 and 478-479. Copyright in a work will be infringed by the unauthorised reproduction of a substantial part of the work: see ss 36(1) and 14 (1) of the Act. In determining whether that has occurred, it is sometimes said that the question is whether the part taken could by itself be the subject of copyright. But as Lord Reid said at 277; 469, when both the questions whether copyright subsists in a work and, if so, whether it has been infringed are in issue: "" ... that is only a shortcut, and the more correct approach is first to determine whether the plaintiffs' work as a whole is `original' and protected by copyright, and then to inquire whether the part taken by the defendant is substantial."" Later in that same case, Drummond J observed (at 490): Ladbroke (Football) Ltd, Reddwood Music and Eisinger proceed on the basis that a composite work made up of pirated material and original material produced by the compiler can itself be an original work possessing copyright, even though it may also infringe the copyright in the pirated material included in it. In my opinion, a work can be an original work in which copyright will subsist, even though it is itself an infringement of the copyright in an earlier work because it is, in part, a copy of a substantial part of that copyright work. This will be the position provided the later work includes qualitatively significant changes to the copies material."
Case12979,discussed,"Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469","However both Mann v Carnell and Benecke involved circumstances where the alleged waiver resulted from a voluntary act by the holder of the privilege, albeit an act which was not intended to waive privilege. The present case involves circumstances where documents were provided under compulsion of law. Several authorities have indicated that the considerations in such cases are likely to be different: see Saunders v Commissioner, Australian Federal Police (1998) 160 ALR 469 at 473; Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364 at 368-9; Goldberg and Anor v Ng and Ors (1995) 132 ALR 57 at 68. 23 Saunders concerned a claim for privilege in respect of documents seized by the AFP as part of an ongoing investigation into the taxation affairs of the applicant. It had been submitted by the AFP in that case that because the applicant failed to claim privilege at the time of the execution of the warrant, he had impliedly waived privilege over the seized documents. In that case, the AFP relied on observations of Mason J in Baker v Campbell at 80 to the effect that the authorities seemed to suggest that privilege was lost as soon as a document passed into the hands of another who may tender it in evidence. French J in Saunders said of these observations at 473: 'With respect, these observations of the majority in Baker v Campbell fall a long way short of the suggestion that the seizure under warrant of a document the subject of legal professional privilege which has not been waived causes that privilege to be lost. The fact that the seizure may have occurred in circumstances in which the officer executing the warrant was unaware of the subsistence of legal professional privilege in the relevant document does not, in my opinion, lead to the conclusion that the privilege is lost.' 24 In Saunders , the applicant claimed to have indicated at the time of the execution of the warrant that he reserved his rights to challenge the lawfulness of the seizure. However in Commissioner of the Police Service v Nirta [2002] 1 Qd R 364, Mullins J held that the right to claim legal professional privilege over documents seized pursuant to a search warrant was not lost because a claim was not made at the time of seizure. Mullins J noted two relevant factors: firstly, that the respondent had been wrongfully informed that he could not contact the solicitors who were acting for him; and secondly, that the claim for privilege was made at the first available opportunity after having spoken with the solicitor acting for him."
Case16577,followed,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27,"The appellant submits that the above conclusion is partly derived from information contained in the statement accompanying the appellant's application for a protection visa relating to the political activities of the appellant's family. The appellant's application for a protection visa was not provided to the Tribunal by the applicant and accordingly, s 424A(1) applied to that statement: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27 . 14 The respondent submits that the reasons for decision suggest that the appellant provided this information to the Tribunal. The respondent points in particular to the Tribunal's comments that: 'At the hearing before me the Applicant repeated that all his family had been involved in the PPP.' 15 The respondent also refers to the following paragraph: 'The Applicant said that as a member of the students' union and the PPP he had been engaged in welfare work, helping poor people and poor students with books and money. He said that he had campaigned for the PPP in the general election which the PPP had won (in 1993, although the Applicant could not remember the year) and in the general election in 1997 which the PPP lost to the PML. He said that his local MNA had been from the PPP between 1993 and 1996 but that at the election in 1997 the PML candidate had been elected. The Applicant said that he himself had stood in the election for local bodies in the late 19990s, which he said had been held on a non-party basis. He said, however, that he had not been elected because the PML was in power.'"
Case3039,followed,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"Had I not formed the opinion that s 424A had not been complied with, I would have granted relief under s 75(v) because the Tribunal used its erroneous understanding, that is, irrelevant material, to come to the conclusion that the appellant was lying about the loss of her house. That conclusion materially affected its reasoning process about her credibility generally so as to lead to the dismissal of her claims. As Mason CJ held in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 355-356 at common law '...the making of findings and the drawing of inferences in the absence of evidence is an error of law. (see too: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Rajamanikkam [2002] HCA 32 ; (2002) 210 CLR 222 at 232-233 [25] - [28] , 238 [49], 251[99].)"
Case21190,applied,SZKSM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 632,"It may not be an appropriate exercise of discretion to extend time, however, where a satisfactory explanation has not been provided for the whole of the delay: QAAH v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 9 at [7] ; SZKSM v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 632 at [20] . In the present Application , that for which there has been no explanation, or no satisfactory explanation, is such delay as occurred after 6 June 2008. A two-month delay after that date is largely unexplained; and following a friend to Queensland and thereby occasioning a further two-month delay falls well short of "" special reason "". And during that period the present Applicant was well aware that her Application was already out of time."
Case18048,referred to,Ron Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar [1999] 2 Qd R 439,"APM then submitted, in reliance upon the principles enunciated in Ron Kingham Real Estate Pty Ltd v Edgar [1999] 2 Qd R 439 at 443 per McPherson JA, that there would be no benefit to the creditors in the trustee company being wound up, and it was trite law that a creditor can claim to be subrogated to the right of indemnity of the trustee company and directly enforce the debt against the trust assets or even the beneficiaries personally. 35 The way in which these submissions were put seemed to relate both to the question of solvency and the discretion to be exercised by the Court as to whether to order a winding up, assuming I was not satisfied as to solvency. As a matter of procedure, APM moved the Court for its removal as trustee, the appointment of a receiver, and that a winding up not be ordered by the Court. 38 As to APM's reliance on Ron Kingham Real Estate 2 Qd R 439, in that case the question of whether the trustee had properly incurred liabilities was not a matter that was or could be in contention. The defendants could not, having authorised the action of the trustee, have complained of a breach of trust. 39 Putting aside the correctness of the decision in Ron Kingham Real Estate 2 Qd R 439 in allowing the trustee's creditor to sue trust beneficiaries directly to enforce the trustee's right of indemnity against the beneficiaries, I do not consider it appropriate where there is an issue or potential issue as to whether the right of indemnity is available in the circumstances of this case to conclude that the creditors should be left to pursue such claims individually. In any event, there is no evidence that there will be sufficient assets to pay the creditors after the secured creditors have been paid. I do not consider that APM's contentions relating to the right of indemnity demonstrate that APM is solvent, assuming that at law there is a right of indemnity in favour of APM, or that such right of indemnity is a factor in favour of exercising my discretion not to wind up the company. If a liquidator is appointed he will be well placed to consider and deal with the question of the right of indemnity, and pursue with priority claims over the beneficiaries. 40 I now turn to other discretionary matters raised by APM and the issue of APM continuing as a trustee and the appointment of a receiver. 41 As I have indicated above, it was contended that if I came to the conclusion that APM had not discharged the burden of proof to show it was solvent, I should not order the winding up of the company but should instead remove it as trustee and appoint a receiver over the trust assets. In support of this approach, evidence was led of a number of creditors who expressed a desire for such a course. It was argued that it would save time and costs if the appropriate person, already familiar with the company, was appointed (in this case Mr Andrew Leonard Dunner). It was further contended that with the number of actions threatened against the company a receiver would be in a better position to defend the company with the aid of the current director, that the principal director (Mr Edwards) who was responsible for the bad state of the books of accounts of the company is no longer involved with APM, and that the current director is taking steps to put the books of accounts in proper order and prepare proper financial statements. 42 In addition, it was argued that because of the operation clause 11 in the Memorandum of Agreement between APM and the developer, Rocco Antonio Calderone, dated 3 August 2005, in the event of the appointment of a liquidator, APM would not be able to rely upon its right of indemnity, as the developer would be released from its duties and obligations under the agreement, and the trust properties would vest in the hands of the beneficiaries. 43 I have come to the view that I should order the winding up of APM despite these contentions. In addition to the views I have expressed in coming to the view that APM has not discharged the burden of proof upon it and my views on the report of Mr Miller of 30 August 2007, I have concluded that APM should be wound up, and that the alternative course of action contended for by APM not be followed, for the following reasons: (i) Whilst some creditors do not want the appointment of a liquidator, this is not the universal view of the unsecured creditors, and in any event is not a decisive factor. (ii) Whilst the appointment of a receiver familiar with the company already may save some time and costs, this is not the important consideration when balanced against the important public interest of ensuring an insolvent company ceases trading even if only a presumed insolvent company. (iii) Clause 11 does not, in my view, release the developer from any past responsibilities or liabilities it may have had under the agreement all it seems to do is to release, upon the appointment of a liquidator, the developer from any further duties and obligations under the agreement from the date of the appointment. In any event, even if clause 11 does have the result as contended for by APM, including the vesting of trust property in the beneficiary, the other factors I have relied upon in these reasons would indicate that it is appropriate for the company to be wind up, the public interest being a paramount consideration where APM is unable to prove its solvency and the books of accounts are incomplete and are unsubstantiated. Upon vesting of the trust property in the beneficiaries, the company will still have a beneficial interest with priority over the beneficiaries if, as trustee, it has a right of indemnity as submitted. If the debts have been incurred in the administration of the trust, the liquidator can call upon the right of indemnity.

Case10779,referred to,Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960,It is unnecessary for present purposes to determine whether or to what extent the provisions of s 122 of the Evidence Act dealing with the circumstances in which privilege may be lost correspond with the common law principles; see Mann v Carnell at [23]; see also Van Zonneveld v Seaton [2004] NSWSC 960 at [11] (per Campbell J).
Case16973,discussed,Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 ,"The respondent submits that where notice in terms of s 41(5) was required, but not given, in respect to the alleged missed credits and payments, then the bankruptcy notice is nevertheless invalid and a nullity and is not saved by the operation of s 306 of the Act . This, he submits, is so on two separate grounds. First, the proper completion of item 5 in the Schedule to bankruptcy notices is a requirement made essential by the Act . Second, in this case, the missed payments and credits not reflected against item 5 could reasonably mislead a debtor in the position of Mr Cumins as to what is necessary to comply with the notice. The respondent, in this respect, relies upon Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 228 CLR 409 at [27] . He submits that as he had not personally made the garnishee and PAYG payments or done the ATO calculations for credits, he could have no idea of what was or was not comprised in the figure $33,456 in Item 5. 64 In Adams v Lambert, upon which the respondent relies, the bankruptcy notice was said to have been invalid because it referred to the incorrect statutory provision under which interest was claimed. It did not concern any asserted overstatement in the bankruptcy notice of the amount due. Section 41(5) had no application. Section 306 did have application but the case is of no assistance in dealing with the nature of the interrelationship between s 41(5) and s 306. 65 Alternatively, even if relevant notice under s 41(5) had been given, s 306 would have no application. I have found that there was no overstatement of the amount due under the bankruptcy notice. No other formal defect or irregularity is relied upon by the respondent. 66 In the present case, the applicant either obtains ""the benefit"" of s 41(5) because no notice was given, or alternatively, if notice was given she has rebutted the allegations of misstatements in the amount stated to be due under the bankruptcy notice. Section 306 relieves against the invalidating consequences of mistakes in the preparation of a bankruptcy notice: Adams v Lambert at [18] and [34]. There were no mistakes in the present bankruptcy notice. The section assumes the existence of a defect or irregularity. This much was conceded by counsel for the respondent. None exists here. Re Florance; Ex parte Turimetta Properties Pty Ltd [1979] FCA 58 ; (1979) 28 ALR 403 , cited by the respondent is of no assistance on this question."
Case18475,cited,Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153,"Traditionally, contract formation is analysed in terms of offer and acceptance. However, as Heydon JA recognised in Brambles Holdings Ltd v Bathurst City Council [2001] NSWCA 61 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 153 at 179, offer and acceptance are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain every case. While it is an error to assume that because something has been done, there must be a contract pursuant to which it has been done, a contract may nevertheless be inferred from the acts and conduct of the parties: Integrated Computer Services Pty Ltd v Digital Equipment Corp (Aust) Pty Ltd (1988) 5 BPR 11,110 at 11,117 per McHugh JA (Hope and Mahoney JJA concurring); Vroon BV v Foster's Brewing Group Ltd [1994] 2 VR 32 at 80 83; Geebung Investments Pty Ltd v Varga Group Investments No 8 Pty Ltd (1995) 7 BPR 14,551 at 14,569; (1995) Aust Contract Reps |P90-059 at 90,322.

There had to be something which amounted to a serious dereliction of duty. Simply instituting or maintaining on instructions proceedings which had no real prospect of success was not such a dereliction of duty."
Case13620,cited,SZIGW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 203,"With respect to the Applicant's attempt to agitate the reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) argument in this Court, ""[i]t is well recognised that the Court may allow a ground of appeal even where that ground was not raised in the Court or Tribunal below but only where all of the relevant facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or a point of law"": SZIGW v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 203 at [13] (citations omitted; emphasis added); see also Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39 ; (1990) 170 CLR 394 (stating that failure to timely raise a point may be deemed waiver of that point). In the instant case, it is at best questionable whether all of the relevant facts that would establish beyond controversy that the Applicant has been employed as a technical assistant are before the Court. In particular, the record does not disclose that the Applicant has ever drafted a patent specification or prosecuted a patent (which is not surprising, given that evidence to that effect might also suggest that the Applicant had committed an offence under s 202 of the 1990 Patents Act ): cf Idoport Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2000] NSWSC 1141 at [31] (suggesting that a ""technical assista nt"" is one who has the duty of prosecuting patent applications on behalf of clients, under the supervision of a registered patent attorney). Even accepting the Applicant's statutory declaration at face value, it states only that he has ""liaised with patent attorneys in relation to the preparation and filing of patent specifications on behalf of [his] clients."" Accordingly, the Applicant's claim under reg 20.3(3)(a)(i) would ordinarily fail at the outset both because it was not clearly raised below and because not all of the facts necessary to make good the point have been established beyond controversy."
Case4243,considered,Scanlan v Swan (1982) 61 FLR 468,"may, with respect, be that a degree of rigidity of thinking and misconception attended the objection decisions insofar as they affirmed the penalty uplift for obstruction. This is not the first occasion either when in practice or thereafter when I have seen an obstruction based penalty uplift imposed on assessment and maintained on objection only to be abandoned in appeal or review proceedings. Those within the Commissioner's office who conceive such a penalty uplift is applicable on assessment or who review the same on objection would be well advised to read the observations made by Helman DCJ (as his Honour then was) on the subject of what does and does not amount to obstruction in Scanlan v Swan (1982) 61 FLR 468 at 472-473 (Special leave to appeal to the High Court from this decision was granted but then revoked on the hearing of the appeal), a judgment described by Gray J in Australian Federation of Air Pilots v Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd (No 1) [1991] FCA 61 ; (1991) 28 FCR 379 at 385 as, ""helpful"". What is relevant for present purposes though is that, in these proceedings, the Commissioner readily and at an early stage conceded that Mr Russell ought to succeed in respect of this aspect of his appeals. That is hardly behaviour consistent with an absence of good faith on the Commissioner's part. The same may be said in respect of the Commissioner's ready and voluntary concession that the amount assessed in the 2002 income year was excessive and in respect of his conceding that the goods and services tax and related penalty assessments were excessive insofar as they related to the ""resident agent amount""."

Case14567,applied,Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444,"The parties were not in dispute as to the principles that apply to the construction of the 981 Patent. I was referred to numerous authorities in which these principles have been clearly articulated, including Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 ( 'Welch Perrin' ) at 610; Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 ( 'Interlego' ) at 478 (see also Stephen J at first instance at 466); D&eacute;cor Corp Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 at 400; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 22 IPR 1 at 18-19; Fresenius Medical Care Australia Pty Ltd v Gambro Pty Ltd (2005) 67 IPR 230 at 236 [39], 238 [52] and 245-246 [91]-[94]; Pfizer Overseas Pharmaceuticals v Ely Lilly &amp; Co (2005) 68 IPR 1 ( 'Pfizer' ) at 52-54 [247]-[250]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 ( 'Kirin-Amgen' ) at 452-457 [27]-[35]; PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston (2005) 216 ALR 41 ( 'PhotoCure' ) at 85 [172] and 85-86 [168]-[174]; Sachtler GmbH &amp; Co KG v RE Miller Pty Ltd (2005) 221 ALR 373 ( 'Sachtler' ) at 380-382 [39]-[42]; Clorox Australia Pty Ltd v International Consolidated Business Pty Ltd (2006) 68 IPR 254 ( 'Clorox' ) at 260-262 [13]-[22]. 64 For present purposes, however, it is helpful to refer specifically to several principles that have particular resonance with the circumstances of this case: (1) The underlying consideration in the construction of the patent is that it is a public instrument, conferring a public monopoly, that is meant to define the monopoly in such a way that it is not capable of being misunderstood: see eg Pfizer at 52 [247]. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and to allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct that is prohibited: see eg Clorox at 261 [18]. (2) The claims define the invention which is the subject of the patent. They must be construed according to their terms by applying the ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument: see eg D&eacute;cor at 400; Clorox at 260 [15]. (3) The claims must be construed in the context of the specification as a whole. The rest of the specification may explain the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of technical terms, or aid in resolving ambiguities in the construction of the claims: Clorox at 260 [16]; Sachtler at 381 [42]. (4) Although the claims are to be construed in the context of the specification as a whole, 'the settled rule is that it is not permissible to vary or qualify the plain or unambiguous meaning of the claim by reference to the body of the specification': see Interlego per Barwick CJ and Mason J at 478. Further, 'it is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of monopoly as fixed by the words of a claim by adding to those words glosses drawn from other parts of the specification. Similarly, if a claim be clear it is not to be made obscure simply because obscurities can be found in particular sentences in other parts of the document': Welch Perrin at 610 per Dixon CJ, Kitto and Windeyer JJ; see also Clorox at 261 [17]. (5) A patent specification must be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction. This involves construing the claims in a practical, commonsense manner, avoiding too technical or narrow a construction of the claims, and preferring a construction under which the invention will work to one where it may not work: Pfizer at 53-54, citing Nesbit Evans Group Australia Pty Ltd v Impro Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 56. It also means construing the claims in light of what a reasonable person to whom the patent was addressed would have understood the language of the claim to mean: Kirin-Amgen at 453-454 [30], [32] and [34] per Lord Hoffman. (6) The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date. The words used in the specification and the claim are to be given the meaning that the skilled addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: Clorox at 261-262 [20]; D&eacute;cor at 391; PhotoCure at 85 [170]. (7) The proper construction of the specification is a matter of law for the Court to determine. However, evidence can be given by experts on the meaning which those skilled in the art would give to technical or scientific terms and phrases and on unusual or special meanings given by such persons to words that might otherwise bear their ordinary meaning: see Clorox at 262 [21]; see also Root Quality Pty Ltd v Root Control (2000) 49 IPR 225 ( 'Root Quality' ) at 237 [49]. 146 Ranbaxy argued that the actions that Warner-Lambert had to take after 30 May 1986 to develop and market a single enantiomeric drug showed that the practical difficulties to which it pointed were very real. In particular, Ranbaxy referred to the fact that Warner-Lambert encountered difficulties with racemic atorvastatin lactone in mid 1987; at that point it decided to resolve the racemate into its individual enantiomers; and on 1 February 1989 Warner-Lambert filed a United States patent application directed to the process it had developed for the chiral synthesis of enantiomers of atorvastatin lactone. Assuming that it is appropriate on a question of construction to have regard to these subsequent events, these matters do not affect my conclusion as to the proper construction of the 981 Patent. On the evidence before me, there was a common expectation prior to 30 May 1986 that single enantiomeric drugs could be commercially produced whether by way of resolution or chiral synthesis. The fact that there were numerous single enantiomeric drugs on the market by that stage confirmed this expectation. The possibility that difficulties may be encountered in developing an enantomeric drug for commercial sale does not have the consequence, in my view, that the 981 Patent should be read down so that it only claims racemic mixtures. It must be borne in mind that the patent is concerned with the grant of a monopoly in respect of the claimed compounds for a period of 20 years. There is no reason to doubt that there was a general expectation that means could be found to develop methods of synthesising single enantomeric drugs for commercial sale over that time frame. To my mind, it is unreasonable to suppose that the patent was intended to be confined to racemates simply because difficulties might arise in the near term in producing a single enantiomeric drug on a commercial scale. In any event, I have grave doubts that subsequent conduct of the kind to which Ranbaxy refers in this argument (as distinct from the surrounding commercial circumstances at 30 May 1986) can properly be used as an extrinsic aid to the proper construction of the 981 Patent: cf FAI Traders Insurance Co Ltd v Savoy Plaza Pty Ltd [1993] 2 VLR 437; see also Kirin-Amgen at 452 [28]."
Case9607,applied,Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7,"In relation to passing off, a statement by Lord Oliver in Reckitt &amp; Colman Ltd v Borden Inc (1990) 17 IPR 1 at 7 is valuable not only for its statement of the law but for its reminder that these kinds of cases turn essentially on their own particular facts. His Lordship said: ""Although your Lordships were referred in the course of argument to a large number of reported cases, this is not a branch of the law in which reference to other cases is of any real assistance except analogically. It has been observed more than once that the questions which arise are in general questions of fact. Neither the appellants nor the respondents contend that the principles of law are in any doubt. The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition - no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying get up (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get up is recognised by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff's goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a representation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff's identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a particular source which is in fact the plaintiff's. For example, if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers, or, in a quia timert action, that he is likely to suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant's misrepresentation that the source of the defendant's goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff."" 121 The findings above lead to these conclusions. Cadbury and Darrell Lea are competitors in the retail chocolate market, yet they each have distinctive product lines which are sold from different sorts of premises under distinctive trade names. They have distinct identities in the market place. Cadbury does not own the colour purple and does not have an exclusive reputation in purple in connection with chocolate. Darrell Lea is entitled to use purple, or any other colour, as long as it does not convey to the reasonable consumer the idea that it or its products have some connection with Cadbury. I am not satisfied that this has occurred, or is likely to occur. 122 There will be an order that the application be dismissed. Darrell Lea foreshadowed an application for indemnity costs. The question of costs will be adjourned to a date to be fixed. Outlines of submissions are to be filed by Darrell Lea seven days and by Cadbury three days before the adjourned date.

Case1220,cited,National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13,"In National Mutual Life Association of Australia Limited v The Commissioner of Taxation [1970] HCA 51 ; (1970) 122 CLR 13 ( 'National Mutual' ), Gibbs J considered the meaning of the phrase 'for the purpose of producing assessable income' in s 88(1) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936 1963 (Cth) in a provision which said, 'where a taxpayer has paid any premium in respect of land, premises or machinery used for the purpose of producing assessable income and in the year of income [certain events occurred] a proportionate part of the amount of that premium ... shall be an allowable deduction'. Gibbs J at page 18 said this: The question then is whether the words ""used for the purpose of producing assessable income"" in s 88(1) and (2) on their proper construction apply to land ... only when it is solely used or chiefly used for the purpose of producing assessable income. The section itself contains no words restricting its operation in that way. If the provisions are literally construed, they apply when the land is used for the purpose of producing some assessable income even though it is used for other purposes as well. No doubt the application of the section might be excluded if the use of the land for the purpose of producing assessable income was so insubstantial as to call for the application of the principle de minimis non curat lex , but it is unnecessary to consider that situation ... [emphasis added] 47 In National Mutual , at page 22, Gibbs J said this: I conclude that the words of s 88 should be given the broad meaning which, in their ordinary and natural sense, they are capable of bearing, and should be understood as including a reference to land which has in fact been used for the purpose of producing assessable income whether or not that was the main use of the land.

Case2642,cited,Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316,For a disease to be compensable under the SRC Act something more than a mere temporal connection must be found; there must be a material contribution towards either the contraction of the disease or an aggravation of it: See the definition of 'disease' in s 4(1) of the SRC Act and Treloar v Australian Telecommunications Commission (1990) 26 FCR 316. The Tribunal's finding that there had been a temporal connection only between the onset of the applicant's symptoms and his work precludes any finding that the applicant had suffered a work-related disease which was therefore compensable.

Case12736,cited,Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688,"The plaintiffs submitted that: (a) It is well established that the use of company funds to defend oppression proceedings may, in certain circumstances, constitute oppression (see Re DG Brims and Sons Pty Ltd (1995) 16 ACSR 559 at 591 592; Fexuto Pty Ltd v Bosnjak Holdings Pty Ltd [1998] NSWSC 413 ; (1998) 28 ACSR 688 at 733; and Cassegrain v CTK Engineering Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 495 ; (2005) 54 ACSR 249 at [90] to [99] (pp 267 269); and Food Improvers Pty Ltd v BGR Corp Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 97 at [250] to [258]). (b) Where the issue has been raised prior to the final determination and there is a significant risk of the company's resources being expended in the defence of the interests of the majority, there is no reason why the Court would not step in at the interlocutory stage and make appropriate orders. In support of this submission, Counsel for the plaintiffs relied upon certain observations made by Brereton J in Grace v Grace (2007) 25 ACLC 141 ; [2007] NSWSC 6 at [52] and at [61] (second dot point). (c) The normal test for the grant of an interlocutory injunction applies in the circumstances of the present case; (d) The plaintiffs have established a strong case that there is a serious question to be tried; and (e) The balance of convenience favours the grant of an injunction because "" ... there is a decidedly uneven playing field ... "" in the sense that the plaintiffs are compelled to fund the litigation in circumstances where they have no assets of any significance whereas their protagonists, the Buskens, have access to company funds. 30 However, that is not the end of the matter. None of the authorities to which I have been referred involved an application for interlocutory relief founded upon the same ground as the ground relied upon by the plaintiffs in the present application. Further, some of those authorities support the proposition that, because it may be difficult to determine on an interlocutory basis which costs may be regarded as the legitimate responsibility of the corporate defendants over which the oppression suit is being fought, courts are reluctant to make a determination in advance, ie, at an interlocutory stage ( Fexuto [1998] NSWSC 413 ; 28 ACSR 688 at 733; 20 28; Re A Company (No 001126 of 1992) [1994] 2 BCLC 146 at 155 156; Grace 25 ACLC 141 ; [2007] NSWSC 6 at [49] to [52] and at [59] to [61]). This latter point may not be a very strong point in favour of the first, second, fourth and fifth defendants in the present case but is one that nonetheless needs to be weighed in the balance. It seems to me that the Court is generally reluctant to interfere at the interlocutory stage with the payment of legal fees and expenses unless there is good reason to do so."
Case24720,cited,Campbell v Metway Leasing Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-630,"In relation to the applicant's allegation that the respondents intentionally caused the applicant to become a bankrupt (par 456), it is clear from the statement of claim that the applicant bitterly resents conduct in which he alleges the respondents engaged which he believes caused his bankruptcy, and indeed bitterly resents the fact of his bankruptcy. However the applicant has become a bankrupt through lawful process in the Federal Court and has throughout that process had opportunities to challenge the circumstances leading to his bankruptcy. I respectfully adopt comments of McInerney J in Campbell v Metway Leasing Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-630. In that case the appellants pleaded undue harassment or coercion by the respondents in relation to, inter alia , issuing two bankruptcy notices where there were allegedly no debts due. His Honour said at 40,916-7: 'In my opinion, however, the institution of legal proceedings which are not themselves vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of process, and therefore liable to be summarily dismissed under Part 13 rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW), cannot constitute ""undue"" harassment or coercion for the purposes of section 55 (Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW), being the NSW equivalent of section 60 Trade Practices Act ) as a plaintiff, within these bounds, has a legitimate right of recourse to the Courts for the determination of their claim or grievance.' 85 To the extent that the third respondent allegedly threatened the applicant with 'a life long vendetta' (par 461), and in relation to the applicant's allegations concerning the alleged theft of files by the third and fourth respondents (par 470), the applicant has not pleaded: a. how the third and fourth respondents, who are individuals, are liable under s 60 Trade Practices Act (assuming that it this section the applicant is relying on in relation to this allegation). b. whether the applicant claims that the corporate respondents are liable in relation to this claim. c. if s 60 is relied on, how the conduct in question is relevant to the provision of goods and services or payment for goods and services as required by the legislation. 86 Further, in relation to the alleged theft of the applicant's files claimed in par 470, I repeat my comments earlier in relation to Count 6 concerning: a. whether this conduct constitutes undue harassment in breach of s 60 and b. the fact that unlawful access of the respondents to the applicant's home and his possessions potentially gives rise to cause of action in the State courts in tort."
Case15865,cited,"Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108; (2008) 249 ALR 762","to these questions and the broader framework of whether an administrative decision-maker has fallen into error of law see Wecker v Secretary, Department of Education, Science and Training [2008] FCAFC 108; (2008) 249 ALR 762, per Greenwood J at [96] to [99], per French J agreeing, at [3] and Weinberg J agreeing at [41]. It follows therefore that if the Tribunal takes an irrelevant consideration into account in reaching its decision, it has engaged in an error of law and the question of whether the Tribunal has taken an irrelevant consideration into account raises a question of law. It also follows that a question of whether the Tribunal has reached a finding unsupported by any evidence, raises a question of law. A contention that inferences have been drawn from facts in circumstances where those inferences are not reasonably open, also raises a question of law. Considerations The position in relation to the resolution of the present application seems to me to be this."

Case12710,cited,SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609,"That has been the subject of further submissions by the first respondent. I do not accept one of those submissions. It is put that the fact of inconsistency in evidence provided to the Tribunal is not itself information which activates the obligation under s 424A of the Act. That is of course generally correct. So much was explained in SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2007) 235 ALR 609. However, I think that principle relates to inconsistencies which emerge in the course of a hearing and does not necessarily relate to inconsistencies which the Tribunal discerns from other information available to it. In my view, the application of that principle depends upon the Court being satisfied that the information provided at the earlier hearing before the first Tribunal was generally information before the Tribunal which did not enliven s 424A at all."
Case4263,applied,The Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10 ; (1997) 187 CLR 297,"As a matter of construction, the use of the verb ""considers"" in s 24CL(3) has the effect of placing that subsection within ""that category of laws whose operation is made conditional upon the opinion or satisfaction as to certain matters of a designated authority or person, with the consequence that the merits of the matter are not examinable upon judicial review"": The Australian Heritage Commission v Mount Isa Mines Ltd [1997] HCA 10 ; (1997) 187 CLR 297 , at 303. As the High Court found in that case (ibid), the word ""considers"" was used to that end in the legislation then under consideration. Later, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21 ; (1999) 197 CLR 611 at 650, [127] et seq, Gummow J, who had been a member of the Full Court which delivered the unanimous joint judgement in The Australian Heritage Commission Case , comprehensively analysed this type of statutory provision and the amenability of decisions made thereunder to judicial review. In the course of that analysis, Gummow J drew attention (at 653-654, [136]) to the following remarks made by Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) in Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24 ; (1976) 135 CLR 110 , at 118-119 in relation to the judicial review of a ""satisfaction"" based decision: In all such cases the authority must act in good faith; it cannot act merely arbitrarily or capriciously. Moreover, a person affected will obtain relief from the courts if he can show that the authority has misdirected itself in law or that it has failed to consider matters that it was required to consider or has taken irrelevant matters into account. Even if none of these things can be established, the courts will interfere if the decision reached by the authority appears so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could properly have arrived at it. However, where the matter of which the authority is required to be satisfied is a matter of opinion or policy or taste it may be very difficult to show that it has erred in one of these ways, or that its decision could not reasonably have been reached. After citing this passage, Gummow J added (at 654, [137]): 137. This passage is consistent with the proposition that, where the criterion of which the authority is required to be satisfied turns upon factual matters upon which reasonable minds could reasonably differ, it will be very difficult to show that no reasonable decision-maker could have arrived at the decision in question. It may be otherwise if the evidence which establishes or denies, or, with other matters, goes to establish or to deny, that the necessary criterion has been met was all one way."
Case6999,cited,Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592,"Paragraph (k) assumes that ownership is to be tested as at the date of filing an application for registration. YD relied on the dictum of Kitto J in Southern Cross Refrigerating Co v Toowoomba Foundry Pty Ltd (1954) 91 CLR 592 at 595 that in ""applications for registration, the rights of the parties are to be determined as at the date of the application"". In Lomas v Winton Shire Council [2002] FCAFC 413 ; [2003] AIPC 91-839 at [37] - [38] , the Full Court said: The basis of any claim to ownership of a trade mark so far unused is to be found in the combined effect of authorship of the mark, the intention to use it upon or in connection with goods or services and applying for registration of the mark - Shell Company of Australia Ltd v Rohm and Haas Company &amp; Anor [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 627 .... Authorship in that sense involves the origination or first adoption of the word as and for a trade mark - Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Company [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 399. Thus, if the Trade Mark had not been used prior to the Priority Date in connection with the goods and services specified in the Application, Ms Lomas should be treated as the owner of the Trade Mark. On the other hand, if Winton is able to establish that, as at the Priority Date, it was the owner of the Trade Mark and not Ms Lomas, the opposition based on s 58 would succeed. 134 I think I should follow Crazy Ron's . There the date at which the validity of registration was to be tested was squarely raised. The decision on this issue was based on the definition of ""applicant"" in s 6. The relevant date was not an issue in Lomas . The Full Court did not refer to the definition of ""applicant"". The question there was who was the owner at the priority date. The parties were not in dispute as to the time at which to test ownership. Nor was the proper date at which the rights of the parties were to be determined an issue in Southern Cross . Further, the Trade Marks Act 1905 contained no definition of ""applicant"". Kitto J's five propositions were, as his Honour said, taken from Romer J's judgment in In re Jellinek's Application (1946) 63 RPC 59 at 78. That was a decision under the Trade Marks Act 1938 (1 &amp; 2 Geo 6 c 22), which contained no definition of ""applicant""."
Case21254,cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Maltsin (2005) 88 ALD 304,"That said, however, the Tribunal must, when requested so to do by an applicant, give genuine consideration to the request. That requires consideration of the evidence that is sought to be led, the person by whom the evidence is to be given, the current state of the evidence before the Tribunal and the potential impact that the evidence, if accepted, might have on the applicant's claims. Otherwise, the Tribunal would not be providing the applicant with a fair hearing which would demonstrate jurisdictional error: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Maltsin (2005) 88 ALD 304. In this case, the Tribunal was not aware that it had Rashed Khan Menon's telephone number and address. It cannot be criticised for not knowing that. The Tribunal was entitled to reason, having regard to the appellant's own evidence and the evidence of his three witnesses, that any further evidence would be of no assistance and not be capable of corroborating the unsatisfactory evidence already received: Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Applicant S20/2002 (2003) 198 ALR 59 per McHugh and Gummow JJ at [49]; WADU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1252 at [45] ."
Case13755,cited,Yalniz v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 426,"In this case there appeared to be limited material before the Minister as to the best interests of each of the applicant's children under the age of 18. Ms Wheatley for the Minister submitted that there was no obligation on the Minister to initiate further inquiries as to information concerning the children, and indeed this point was not in contention: cf Djalic v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 151 ; (2004) 139 FCR 292 at 314, Taylor [2005] FCAFC 208 at [19] , Yalniz v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 426 at [24] .

Our son and he are very close. The bond they enjoy is enormous and I fear the Joshua will not be able to understand or cope with suddenly losing someone who is such a big part of his life. He look (sic) up to his father and loves him so much."" o it was open to the Minister to find from the information given that the cancellation of the applicant's visa and his removal from Australia would have a detrimental effect on his younger children &#8226; a submission from the applicant wherein, inter alia , the applicant stated that: o if his visa were removed his children would suffer the consequences o he had duties towards his children o there was a very close and strong bond between himself and his children &#8226; a submission from Larni Holani in support of her father, indicating a close relationship with her father. In that letter Ms Holani made no reference to access or living arrangements except to say that her mother has raised her, as has her father (RBRD 1 p 244) &#8226; a submission from Leonard Holani, a child of the applicant over 18 years of age, dated 6 October 2006 wherein Mr Holani stated that his five brothers and sisters all relied on the applicant either financially or emotionally, and that ""I believe my youngest brothers and sisters would be affected the most as they are still quite young and need a father figure in their lives as does any child"" (RBRD 1 p 245) &#8226; a submission from James Gordon Wallace dated 1 October 2006 (RBRD 1 pp 248-249) wherein Mr Wallace states that, inter alia , the applicant is a doting and loving father of six children, and that, with respect to the children under 18 years, ""Larni Holani, his eldest daughter, presently attends the Carina San Sisto Girls College and again Clyde Holani has paid for her schooling. Darryl Holani is autistic, attends a special school and needs the ongoing support of his father. Nakita [sic] and Joshua Holani attend a public primary school prior to receiving a private school education ostensibly to be funded by their father should he still reside in Australia."" &#8226; a submission from Sqn Ldr S J Curran (Rtd) dated 25 September 2006 (RBRD 1 pp 254-255) containing the following: ""His elder daughter is Larni born 2 November 1989 completes year 12 this year. Three younger children are: Darryl born 21 November 1996 Nakita [sic] born 31 March 1998 Joshua born 22 August 2000 Clyde paid for his children's education to ensure they would have a good future. The four younger children show great affection for their father. I think I recall I said in my last letter it would be heartbreaking to separate the children from their father, particularly as their biological mother shows little affection toward them. Clyde's partner Vicky Wallace has been living with him since 2000. She is very good with the young children and it is obvious that they are also very affectionate toward her."""

Case8799,followed,Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543,"Some basic propositions about s 21 should be borne in mind before approaching the detail of the issue. (1) ""Knows"" and ""known"" are strong words. They mean considerably more than ""believes"" or ""suspects"" or even ""strongly suspects"" (per McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd v FAI General Insurance Co Ltd (in liq) [2003] HCA 25 ; (2003) 214 CLR 514 at 531; see also Commercial Union Assurance Co of Australia Ltd v Beard (1999) 47 NSWLR 735; (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 61-458 per Davies A-JA at 75259). (2) The ""matter"" must be known to the insured. (3) On one alternative, the ""matter"" must also be known to be relevant to the decision of the particular insurer whether to accept risk, and, if so, on what terms in this case, on the basis put forward, by Macquarie Underwriting. As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [70] : ""Under the Act, attention is shifted from the prudent insurer to the particular insurer."" Although their Honours were in dissent in the result, this statement is obviously correct. (See also Twenty-First Maylux Pty Ltd v Mercantile Mutual Insurance (Aust) Ltd [1990] VR 919 ; (1989) 92 ALR 661.) (4) Relevance to the acceptance of the risk in the sense of the particular insurance hazard is required (McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [32] ). (5) In the other alternative, it must be found that a reasonable person in the circumstances could be expected to know that the matter was relevant to the decision of the particular insurer. There is some debate about the meaning of the words ""the circumstances"". Although they plainly mean the circumstances of the particular case, the debate is said to be between subjective and extrinsic circumstances (see the discussion in Mann P, Annotated Insurance Contracts Act (4 th ed, Lawbook Co, 2003), para 21.10.8). (6) There is a debate as to whether an insured can ""know"" a matter by its agent cf McHugh, Kirby and Callinan JJ at [30] with Gummow and Hayne JJ in Permanent Trustee Australia Ltd [2003] HCA 25 ; 214 CLR 514 at [82] [89]. Pending further clarification by the High Court, the wider view should be taken following Macquarie Bank Ltd v National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 543 per Powell JA at 610 611 (agreed with by Priestley JA and Clarke JA). (7) The obligation applies to renewal of a contract (s 11(9)(b)) ( Alexander Stenhouse Ltd v Austcan Investments Pty Ltd [1993] HCA 22 ; (1993) 112 ALR 353)."
Case21249,cited,Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833,"Recently, a question very similar to that which arises in this case, arose before Buchanan J in an application for civil penalties by an Australian Building and Construction Commission inspector: Alfred v Lanscar [2007] FCA 833. As part of an investigation into alleged breaches of the WR Act statements were taken from a number of people. They were signed and witnessed. The Commission subsequently sought to rely upon affidavits sworn or affirmed by people from whom the statements were taken in which they deposed to the truth and accuracy of the statements and exhibited them to the affidavits. Eight statements adopted in that fashion were relied upon at the hearing before Buchanan J as part of evidence-in-chief in the applicant's case. 20 Buchanan J ruled that the witness statements were made admissible by their adoption in the affidavits. Although his ruling was made in the course of the hearing, his Honour subsequently reduced his reasons for decision to writing. 21 Buchanan J referred to s 37 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and in particular s 37(3) which contemplates the exercise by a court of power in the rules of court to allow a written statement or report to be tendered or treated as evidence-in-chief of its maker. A question arose whether the statements adopted by the witnesses were hearsay within the meaning of s 59 of the Evidence Act . His Honour held that if they were they would fall within an exception to the hearsay rule in s 63 and not be inadmissible for that reason. He referred to the decision of the Full Court in Platcher v Jones [2004] FCAFC 68. He did not read the observations of their Honours as turning on the requirements of s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act . I respectfully agree with his Honour's observations. His Honour rejected the objection taken to the admissibility of the statements. He also rejected a separate submission that the Court should require the evidence to be given orally in any event. He saw no reason to depart from earlier directions that the conduct of the proceedings be by affidavit. His Honour said (at [4 ]): In the circumstances, I will admit the statements in question in the sense that I will not exclude them from the evidence upon the basis which has so far been argued. However, it follows that if the statements are to be treated as part of the evidence in chief, as I think they should be, then they will be subject to objections in the ordinary way upon some other foundation if that appears to be available. Such objections will need to be dealt with as they are taken. I reject the objection so far taken in a general way to the statements in question."
Case1730,applied,R v Propsting [2009] VSCA 45,"the criminal law it is established that a maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed.

In R v Propsting [2009] VSCA 45 , Vincent JA said at [15]: There is a stage at which conduct becomes so egregious that it must be regarded as being of a kind attracting the imposition of a very substantial, if not the maximum, penalty for the commission of the offence involved regardless of whether a more serious example could be imagined."

The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 92 The taxpayer applicants drew further attention, in the present context of discussion, to the following opinions of Lord Hobhouse in Arthur S Hall &amp; Co v Simons [2000] UKHL 38 ; [2002] 1 AC 615 at 743 as to the operation of the principle of abuse of process: 'The ""collateral attack"" point is a species (or ""sub-set "") of abuse of process. There is no general rule preventing a party inviting a court to arrive at a decision inconsistent with that arrived at in another case. The law of estoppel per rem judicatam (and issue estoppel ) define when a party is entitled to do this. Generally there must be an identification of the parties in the instant case with those in the previous case and there are exceptions. So far as questions of law are concerned, absent a decision specifically binding upon the relevant litigant, the doctrine of precedent governs when an earlier legal decision may be challenged in a later case. A party is not in general bound by a previous decision unless he has been a party or privy to it or has been expressly or implicitly covered by some order for the marshalling of litigation ( Ashmore v British Coal Corpn [1990] 2 QB 338 ). This overlaps with the concept of vexation where the same person is faced with successive actions making the same allegations which have already been fully investigated in a previous case in which the later claimant had an opportunity to take part. This reasoning does not apply to an action against a lawyer alleging that he has mishandled a previous case.' I have earlier made reference to dictum of Lord Hoffman appearing in Arthur S Hall, in the context of my earlier citation from Spalla of the public policy element which assists to define the scope of the doctrine of abuse of process, and I have of course already discussed the judicial notion of ' privy '. The taxpayer applicants contended that it could not be said that they had an ' opportunity to take part ' in what was described by them as '... a contest over the liability to tax in respect of other years and in respect of other taxpayers'. That contention was contextually related to the further proposition of the taxpayer applicants that '... the Commissioner's submission that the present taxpayers and Spassked are controlled by the same entity, is in the present circumstances, irrelevant to the question of abuse of process'. I have difficulty in understanding why that should be so. Control by the same corporate entity, for instance the control of a holding company over its wholly owned subsidiaries, may surely be a factor of potential relevance to the resolution of an issue as to abuse of process which focuses upon the conduct of the controlled entity and a relevantly related company, especially in circumstances of entire (ie wholly owned) shareholding control. As exemplified in passages I have earlier extracted from the judgments in Spassked at first instance and appeal, evidence was led as to the operations, activities and decision making of and in relation to IEL wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries comprising the taxpayer applicants in particular, in relation to periods of time both prior and subsequent to the 1992 fiscal years. A similar observation is seemingly apposite to the purported reliance by the taxpayer applicants upon the following dictum of Heydon JA (as he then was and with whom Spigelman CJ and Mason P agreed), in R v O'Halloran [2000] NSWCCA 528 ; (2000) 36 ACSR 315 at 342-344, in the course of which his Honour observed that '[t]he law prevents Mrs Fenwick relitigating in civil proceedings issues decided in earlier civil proceedings; it does not necessarily prevent a non-party, namely the director, litigating issues for the first time in criminal proceedings' . What of course is here relevantly involved are civil proceedings alone."
Case2539,cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Gas Light Co (1983) 74 FLR 13 ,"The Commissioner submitted that it is a fundamental defect in BARM's argument that it impermissibly seeks to make derivation of the income amount (the debt/payment in respect of management services) dependent upon the capacity to recover the capital asset arising from investment of the income (the debt owing by PGF). Apart from the illogicality of the contended dependence, it is relevant to note that even if there had been an impediment to recovery of the debt on income account, that would not lead to the result that it would not have been derived as income. In Barratt at 232, Gummow J (Northrop and Drummond JJ agreeing) drew attention to the distinction between: (a) the situation where a debt has not come into existence, with the result that income will not have been derived (an example of which was Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Australian Gas Light Co (1983) 74 FLR 13); and (b) the situation where a debt has come into existence, but there is an impediment to recovery. Accordingly, statutory prohibitions against recovery of fees for medical services pursuant to s 35(2) of the Medical Practitioners Act 1938 (NSW) were only impediments to enforcement that did not lead to the result that taxpayers assessable on an accruals basis had not derived the fees as income."
Case1704,followed,Leghaei v Director-General of Security [2007] FCAFC 56,"carefully studied the redacted parts of the respondent's affidavit I have concluded that they should not be made available to the applicants' legal advisers, even on the giving of appropriate undertakings. There are many cases that establish that courts should attach very considerable weight to the view of what national security requires as is expressed by the responsible officer. See for example Leghaei v Director-General of Security [2007] FCAFC 56 at [56] - [58] , [62]. Although usually expressed in connection with the inspection of protected documents themselves, those observations apply also to an affidavit, such as that sworn in this case, which supplies the reasons for the claim to privilege. In the open part of his affidavit the respondent says that the disclosure of the redacted portions of his affidavit would be likely to prejudice national security. In the balance of the affidavit, in particular the redacted parts, he explains the basis for his opinion. Having read those parts, I am satisfied that the opinion is soundly based. Accordingly, the respondent may rely on his affidavit in support of his public interest claim without providing to the applicants' legal representatives the redacted parts thereof. The next question is whether the respondent's public interest immunity claims should be upheld. In Church of Scientology v Woodward [1982] HCA 78 ; (1980) 154 CLR 25 at 76 Brennan J said: Discovery would not be given against the Director-General [of Security] save in a most exceptional case. The secrecy of the work of an intelligence organization which is to counter espionage, sabotage, etc. is essential to national security, and the public interest in national security will seldom yield to the public interest in the administration of civil justice ... ... the veil of secrecy is not absolutely impenetrable ... But the veil is not penetrated merely by a plaintiff's deposition that he is not a security risk. That, after all, may be the very matter which is under investigation. See also Leghaei v Director-General of Security [2007] FCAFC at [52] and R v Khazaal [2006] NSWSC at [31]-[32]."
Case24376,referred to,Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550,"The High Court said that the common law principles of procedural fairness required the Tribunal to advise the applicants of the substance of the allegations in the letter. The Tribunal was not required to give the applicants a copy of the letter or provide any information which would have identified the author of the letter (at [7]). The Court referred to certain statutory provisions, but said that in the circumstances the case was to be decided by reference to the common law principles of procedural fairness. The Court referred to the reasons for judgment of Brennan J in Kioa v West [1985] HCA 81 ; (1985) 159 CLR 550 at 628-629. The Court concluded that the Tribunal had an obligation to draw the applicants' attention to the information in the letter. The Court then said (at 98 [22]-[23]): ""The fact that the author of the letter asked the Department to keep it secret did not mean that equitable principles about confidential information were to be engaged in deciding what course the Tribunal took. Rather, the nature and extent of the Tribunal's obligation to disclose the information were regulated by the Act and the obligation to accord the appellant procedural fairness. In this case, the particular content of the obligation to accord procedural fairness was to be identified having regard not only to the particular provisions of the Act that regulated the Tribunal's work but also to the scope and objects of the Act as a whole. In that latter regard, it is necessary to keep two propositions at the forefront of consideration. First, the Act required that those entitled to a particular visa be granted the visa they sought, and that those not entitled be refused. Secondly, the Act committed the decision to grant or refuse a visa to the Executive government and the Tribunal was likewise exercising executive power, not judicial power."" 57 The Court said that there was a public interest in the Executive government, when making its decision, not being denied information that has been or may later be supplied by an informer (at 98 [24]). That public interest and the rules of procedural fairness could be accommodated by a requirement that the applicant be advised of substance of the allegations and asking him to respond to those allegations (at 100 [29]). The Court concluded that the Tribunal had not complied with the rules of procedural fairness. 58 The decision in VEAL suggests that in this case the Minister was obliged to disclose to the applicant the substance of the information in the Parole Board reports. The Minister sought to meet the difficulty caused by the fact that he had not done so by submitting that the obligation did not arise in this case because the information in the Parole Board reports was either information from the applicant, or was information which was not adverse to the applicant or was information he already had from other sources. The other sources identified by the applicant were a report of Mr Sowerbutts dated 29 August 2006 and Ms Beevor's report. A decision-maker's obligation of disclosure where the common law rules of procedural fairness apply has been discussed in a number of cases. I need go no further than refer to the two well-known decisions of Kioa v West (supra) at 628-629 per Brennan J; Commissioner for Australian Capital Territory Revenue v Alphaone Pty Ltd (1994) 49 FCR 576 at 588-592. 59 In this case the Minister presented a schedule of the information in the Parole Board reports and of where he said it either came from the applicant, or was not adverse or was known to the applicant from other sources. The Minister did not submit that there was not information in the Parole Board reports which was ""credible, relevant and significant to the decision to be made"" ( Kioa v West (supra) at 629 per Brennan J). There are obvious difficulties with the Minister's submission. For example, unless the same words are used, it will sometimes be difficult to determine if the information provided by the applicant or said to have been available from another source is actually the same information which the applicant claims ought to have been disclosed. 60 In this case, there clearly was information in the Parole Board reports which was adverse and was not provided by the applicant or to him from other sources. That information related to concerns about where the applicant proposed to live in relation to his victim. The substance of that information should have been disclosed to the applicant. The applicant now has the Parole Board reports and it is not necessary for me to go further and express a conclusion in relation to each piece of information in the Parole Board reports. 61 The applicant has established a breach of the rules of procedural fairness. 62 The applicant submitted that by reason of the decision-maker's conduct he was denied the opportunity to put his case and has been denied procedural fairness. Of course, the Minister and the officers of his Department did not prevent the applicant from putting forward whatever information he considered appropriate; in fact, he was encouraged by an officer of the Minister's Department to put his best foot forward. However, his case is that by reason of a representation made to him he did not put forward all the information he would otherwise put forward. 63 Two decisions of the High Court have dealt with the question of whether there had been a breach of the rules of procedural fairness in circumstances where an applicant, as a result of something said by the decision-maker, did not present to the decision-maker all of the evidence and submissions he would otherwise have presented."
Case5592,cited,R v Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503 ; (2000) 158 FLR 359,"It seems to me that the case must fail unless I find that Mr Manchee made the supposition in precisely those terms. This is because the authorities establish the central importance of the identified information to the statutory scheme: see R v Hannes [2000] NSWCCA 503 ; (2000) 158 FLR 359 at [26] [27] per Spigelman CJ. Reference has also been made to the level of precision required in formulating the charge: see Hannes v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373 ; 60 ACSR 1 at [377] , [415] per Barr and Hall JJ. 558 The position seems to me to be analogous to that which was referred to by Spigelman CJ in R v Hannes at [254] [257]. Here the supposition that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the Patrick takeover was one essential part of the ""information"" on which the claim was based. As Spigelman CJ said at [257], if it was generally available, one would expect to find it in the contemporaneous reports. Yet no such evidence was available, even in the form of speculation or rumour. 559 Mr Mews and Mr Sisson agreed that when one is considering whether information in the form of a deduction is generally available, the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle is apt. But as Mr Sisson said, if all pieces other than those from a small area are removed, as Mr Mews appears to have done, it is relatively easy to fit the remaining pieces together to reach the desired conclusion. 560 Counsel for Citigroup pointed to the evidence of Mr Harvey to support a finding that the information was generally available. Mr Harvey was called by ASIC to give evidence on its behalf."

In such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive, or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts or the clearly established law.

Case13057,followed,SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315,"response the respondent submitted in summary: The Tribunal did consider the claim of the appellants concerning their membership of a particular social group, namely wealthy middle class businessmen, but it was in the context of the primary submission of the appellants before the Tribunal which was that the male appellant was being persecuted due to his perceived association and support for various Tamil groups. The issue whether a particular social group needs to be considered if there has been no persecution was recently considered by Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315. The Tribunal found, as a finding of fact, a lack of credibility in the appellants' account of events which formed the basis for the claim of a well-founded fear of persecution. In short, the Tribunal did not accept that the appellants left Sri Lanka in the circumstances claimed, nor that they had been targeted by the Sri Lankan security forces, the army, the paramilitary, the Karuna nor anyone else. No jurisdictional error or error in the decision of the Federal Magistrate was apparent in this ground of appeal. Consideration Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention provides that a ""refugee"" is a person who: owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. In applying Art 1A(2) of the Convention and the concept of ""persecution"" in the context of the Migration Act , s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) relevantly provides: (1) For the purposes of the application of this Act and the regulations to a particular person, Article 1A(2) of the Refugees Convention as amended by the Refugees Protocol does not apply in relation to persecution for one or more of the reasons mentioned in that Article unless: (a) that reason is the essential and significant reason, or those reasons are the essential and significant reasons, for the persecution; and (b) the persecution involves serious harm to the person; and (c) the persecution involves systematic and discriminatory conduct. (2) Without limiting what is serious harm for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), the following are instances of serious harm for the purposes of that paragraph: (a) a threat to the person's life or liberty; (b) significant physical harassment of the person; (c) significant physical ill treatment of the person; (d) significant economic hardship that threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (e) denial of access to basic services, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist; (f) denial of capacity to earn a livelihood of any kind, where the denial threatens the person's capacity to subsist. I accept Ms McWilliam's submission that this case is not out of the ordinary, so that as a general proposition the Tribunal must consider the appellants' case by reference to the particular social group articulated by them (cf Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315). However, the appellants' case is (and must be in order to satisfy the requirements of the Migration Act and the definition of ""refugee"" for the purposes of the Convention), that they had a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of their membership of a particular social group. As submitted by the Minister, in essence the Tribunal made a factual finding that the appellants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution for any reason, because the Tribunal did not accept that the appellants had previously been the subject of abduction, assault, harassment or other forms of serious harm which complaints formed the basis of the appellants' claims of their well-founded fear of persecution before the Tribunal. If the appellants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution as contemplated by s 91R(1) of the Migration Act , as the Tribunal found, the Tribunal was entitled to affirm the decision of the Minister not to grant the appellants Protection (Class XA) visas. Ms Wheatley for the first respondent also directed my attention to recent comments of Besanko J in SZJRU v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 315 at [50] where, after referring to Dranichnikov [2003] HCA 26 ; (2003) 197 ALR 389 , his Honour said: Notwithstanding these principles, it is not necessarily an error for the Tribunal not to begin with (or even to deal with) the question of whether there is a particular social group ... If the serious harm results from the application of a law of general application and there is no discrimination and therefore no persecution, the claim must fail ..."
Case12476,discussed,United Mexican States v Cabal (2001) 209 CLR 165,"application for leave or special leave to appeal is not an appeal.

In DJL v The Central Authority [2000] HCA 17 ; (2000) 201 CLR 226 at 248 [47] Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said: ""An application for special leave ""is not in the ordinary course of litigation"" and, until the grant of special leave, ""there are no proceedings inter partes before the Court ( Collins v The Queen [1975] HCA 60 ; (1975) 133 CLR 120 at 122). Further, the disposition of a special leave application is not the determination of an appeal ( Attorney-General (Cth) v Finch [No 2] [1984] HCA 40 ; (1984) 155 CLR 107 at 115) . The result is that the refusal of an application for special leave does not produce a final judgment of this Court which forecloses the re-opening of the matter in an appropriate and, necessarily, very special case where the interests of justice so require."""
Case20005,considered,Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1947] HCA 64 ; (1948) 77 CLR 299,"Lindsay drew attention furthermore to what was described as the leading authority on the meaning of the combined expression process or treatment, as appears in the context of sub-paragraph (a)(iii) of the definition of 'aids to manufacture' contained in the legislative precursor to the STEC Act, being the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 (Cth), the words process or treatment appearing of course in each of pars (a), (b) and (c) of the Item 18(5) definition of manufacture-related activity. That authority is Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd (1981) 33 ALR 251, which was decided by the Supreme Court of Victoria (Gobbo J) at first instance, and which decision was upheld on appeal to a Full Court (Lush, Kaye and Brooking JJ) (1981) 37 ALR 595. At first instance, Gobbo J reviewed (at 268) dictionary meanings of processing and treatment , as follows: 'Turning first to the meaning of ""processing or treatment"", there is nothing in the context of Item 113C to suggest that the ordinary meaning of treatment found for Item 14 should not be adopted. Treatment was there taken to mean the act of subjecting to chemical or physical action so as to bring about a change in form nature or condition. I further found that in its context such treatment had to be directed to a relevant result, namely to use or marketability. As to processing this in my view should in its context in Item 113C and Reg 4 be taken to have a different and probably wider meaning than treatment.... These meanings all suggest that a change in nature form or condition is effected. I am disposed to the view that even in processing some change must result if this procedure is to be regarded as a process.' Lindsay drew attention in particular to 'subjecting to... physical action... [and] condition' , and also to 'use or marketability', appearing above, being expressions reflected explicitly or implicitly in Item 18(5)(a) to (c) within the definition of manufacture-related activity . After referring to Davies Coop and Company Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1947] HCA 64 ; (1948) 77 CLR 299, Gobbo J observed at 269 in Hamersley Iron that authority 'supports a meaning of processing that does not require that there be a change producing a commercially distinct article...', and his Honour referred to recent English authority which had 'adopted the view... that alteration of the material was not necessary to involve subjecting it to a process'. That submission was soundly conceived. 57 The Commissioner submitted however that the reasons for decision in Hamersley Iron at first instance and on appeal did not support Lindsay's case, upon the basis that '[r]efrigeration is not a chemical change, and it is doubtful whether it would be regarded as a physical action on the goods of the sort contemplated by the definition of a manufacture-related activity within subItem 5(5)'. The difficulty for the Commissioner is that even if a chemical change is not effected by refrigeration, refrigeration must at least involve physical action. Lindsay pointed out that in Hamersley Iron, '[t]he stacker and reclaimer were machines which physically stacked, and then physically blended the iron ore to ensure homogeneity', which the Commissioner appeared to accept was sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that a process or treatment was involved. However the Commissioner contended further that 'the mere cooling of goods during transport is qualitatively different from the process under consideration in Davies ', because there the winding of the yarn onto the cones and tubes was described as 'part of the process of bringing the ultimate product, namely the piece goods, into a form or condition in which they could be marketed' . The difficulty for the Commissioner flowing from any comparison of the factual circumstances in Hamersley Iron , and also in Davies , is that whilst the physical outcome of the process or treatment might be described in each case as more significant in terms of process and extent of change, the STEC notion of applying a process or treatment of goods appearing in the Item 18(5) definition of manufacture-related activity would clearly enough accommodate situations of varying degree, depending upon the nature and extent of the process or treatment the subject of application. I have not found the Commissioner's endeavours to distinguish the circumstances in Hamersley Iron (or Davies for that matter) from the present to be persuasive."
Case4366,followed,"Re Cao, ex parte Dixon v Cao [1994] FCA 536","Davies' judgment in Re Cao, ex parte Dixon v Cao [1994] FCA 536 provides an interesting analysis of the case law dealing with the inclusion of contingent liabilities in the assessment of insolvency for the purposes of s 120 of the Act. His Honour relied on this extract by Cotton LJ in Re Ridler; Ridler v Ridler (1882) 22 Ch.D. 74 at 82: Then as to the point that the settler was not indebted, but only subject to a liability which might never become a debt. A man is not at liberty to take a sanguine view, but is bound to act upon a reasonable view of what is likely to happen. After discussing what his Honour called a ""clear line of authorities"", his Honour concluded that, ""[i]n a determination of the issue whether the settler can pay 'all his debts', it is necessary to take account of contingent liabilities and, if necessary, to make a valuation"" (at 6 7). Justice Einfeld in Re Finney; Official Trustee in Bankruptcy v Finney (1996) 35 ATR 259 endorsed the decision in Re Cao and also relied on the decisions in Re Saebar and Re Hyams in holding that contingent and prospective liabilities are relevant debts for the exercise of determining solvency pursuant to s 120 of the Act. At 270, Einfeld J said, ""[i]t is clear law that a prospective liability for a debt should only be disregarded if it is purely speculative and without any real likelihood of being imposed""."

Case15942,distinguished,Tanari v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2005] AATA 419,"However, s306AA is not concerned with a stay of a decision refusing an application for registration which was deemed continuing by force of s 300(1) and (4). Rather, s 306AA deals with orders staying a decision under s 303 to cancel or suspend the registration of an agent who has already been registered for the current year; that is, prior to the cancellation or suspension. This was illustrated in Tanari v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2005] AATA 419 ("" Tanari ""). 58 Section 300 lays down a different regime for deemed registration. Quite plainly, a migration agent whose application for registration in the current year is granted, is no longer deemed registered; s/he is actually registered. But the registration is treated as having taken effect at the end of the expiry date; ie from the commencement of the current year; see s 300(6). 59 Section 300(4)(b) and (c) therefore deal with the situation where the MARA decides, during the period of deemed continuation of registration (but before the grant of any application for registration), to suspend or cancel the agent's registration. The relevant regime is explained by reference to s 300(2) and (3) when read with s 300(4)."

There is no suggestion, nor could there be, that there was any fiduciary relationship between the second respondents and the applicant.

It was accepted that a plea that the second respondents knowingly participated in a breach by the first respondent of his duty of confidence with the kind of knowledge pleaded in par 28 of the PFASC could be allowed to stand. 55 In Consul Development Pty Ltd v DPC Estates Pty Ltd , Gibbs J (at 398) and Stephen J (at 412) with whom Barwick CJ agreed expressed different views as to the knowledge required to establish liability in circumstances of this kind.

Because of the uncertainty in the law in Australia on this topic, it would be difficult to conclude that a plea of the kind in par 28 was untenable: Short (as Executrix of the Estate of Short (decd)) v Crawley (No 25) [2005] NSWSC 928 per White J at [43]; The Bell Group Ltd (in liq) v Westpac Banking Corporation and Ors (No 5) [2004] WASC 273.

Mr Priestley points to Deane J's statement in Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30 ; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 74 where his Honour noted that one of the categories of disqualification by reason of appearance of bias was ' disqualification by interest... where some direct or indirect interest in the proceedings, whether pecuniary or otherwise, gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of prejudice '. Mr Priestley submits that I have an interest in the proceedings and that I am biased as a rule making judge of the Federal Court. 10 Further, it is Mr Priestley's submission that there is no judge presently sitting on the Federal Court who can sit on his case, either because that judge was also a rule making judge with respect to the impugned rule, or because the judge has applied s 31A of the Act. Although judges have been appointed to the bench since O 20 r 5 was passed, Mr Priestley submits that these judges are also biased as they have applied s 31A of the Act in their judgments. Mr Priestley says that would give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of that judge because he or she has therefore been influenced by Parliament. 11 Mr Priestley proffers two alternatives to myself or any other judge of the Court hearing his matter. He submits that the matter could be referred to the High Court under s 40 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ('the Judiciary Act ') and that he could apply for a writ of prohibition and ask the High Court to issue s 78B notices in order for the High Court to examine the constitutional validity of s 31A of the Act. The other alternative Mr Priestley proffers is that Parliament appoint a new judge to the Federal Court to sit on his case."

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Limited (2001) ATPR 41-815 ("" ACCC v ABB No 1 ""), Finkelstein J said at 42,938: ""If general deterrence is the principal object of imposing a penalty, the number of cases that still come before the court, and the seriousness of the conduct that is involved in some of them, suggests that past penalties are not achieving that object. For a penalty to have the desired effect, it must be imposed at a meaningful level. Most antitrust violations are profitable. Accordingly, the penalty must be at a level that a potentially-offending corporation will see as eliminating any prospect of gain."" More recently in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Limited [2005] FCAFC 247 , the Full Court of the Federal Court said at [11]: ""As the cases to which the judge was referred show, the principal, if not the sole, purpose for the imposition of penalties for a contravention of the antitrust provisions in Part IV is deterrence, both specific and general. This rule is so well entrenched that citation of authority is unnecessary. Moreover, as deterrence (especially general deterrence) is the primary purpose lying behind the penalty regime, there inevitably will be cases where the penalty that must be imposed will be higher, perhaps even considerably higher, than the penalty that would otherwise be imposed on a particular offender if one were to have regard only to the circumstances of that offender."" These observations are pertinent in the present circumstances."
Case20780,discussed,Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd (CMI Toyota) [2008] FCAFC 171,"IRCSA appeal was listed for hearing on 30 April 2009. On 2 April 2009, his Honour Senior Judge Jennings gave directions for the exchange of outlines of submissions in relation to both the jurisdictional issue and the merits of the appeal. It is unclear what the ""jurisdictional issue"" is. It may be that there is an issue as to whether an appeal lies without the making of orders (although as noted in [8] of these reasons, s 187(1) of the FW Act would appear to accommodate such an appeal). It may be that there is an issue whether that appeal is competent, having regard to the ""matter"" including the federal element and the provisions of ss 850(2) and 853 of the WR Act. As to that, see the decision in ISS Health v Duthie [2007] SAIRC 94 at [45] . See also Kronen v Commercial Motor Industries Pty Ltd (CMI Toyota) [2008] FCAFC 171 ( Kronen ) at [4] and [7]. It may be that the appeal may be incompetent because it is not an appeal from the whole of the decision, but only that part of it which related to the period up to 26 March 2006. In Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171 , an Industrial Magistrate of the IRCSA had considered claims for underpayment of wages for overtime work and for underpayment of superannuation contributions. The written reasons for judgment dismissed the claim for overtime pay, but made no order reflecting the Industrial Magistrate's conclusions on the superannuation claim. The Full Court (Gray, Branson and Lander JJ) observed at [14]: The industrial magistrate made no order reflecting the conclusions he had reached on the superannuation claim. He neither dismissed the claim (which he was bound to do, if he came to the conclusion that he had no power to order the making of payments) nor made any purported declaration reflecting the conclusion to which he had come as to the meaning and effect of the provisions of the Award relating to superannuation. His Honour seems to have thought that the expression of a conclusion in his reasons for judgment was sufficient. It was not. The whole of the application by summons before the court needed to be dealt with. Plainly, because the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the superannuation claim, that aspect of the application was required to be dismissed. There is nothing in the FW Act (which continues the existence of IRCSA established first under the Industrial Relations Act 1972 (SA) which requires its decisions to be reflected in formally drawn orders so that its orders must be drawn up and sealed. Nor is there anything in the South Australian Industrial Proceedings Rules (SA) dealing with those topics. In Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171 , the Full Court clearly accepted that the expression of an order dismissing the claim for overtime payments in the reasons for decision was sufficient to enliven the right of appeal, subject to granting leave to appeal if that were necessary: see at [15]. Clearly, that decision is different from the present circumstances. It is clear that the fact that the IRCSA does not routinely draw up formal orders after a decision (including reasons for decision) does not of itself impede the right of appeal under s 853 of the WR Act: see Kronen [2008] FCAFC 171. It therefore falls to consider whether the Industrial Magistrate, in particular by [39] of his reasons set out above, has in substance finally determined the issue as to how the parties' legal rights are to be assessed. Had the word ""determine"" been substituted for the word ""conclude"", or been used in conjunction with it, there would in my view have been no scope for debate about that. The limited liberty to apply as to the quantum reflects such an intention. In my view, the existence or otherwise of a right of appeal should not be determined by the precise word or words used, but by their substantive effect. I do not need to decide that issue because the appellant has taken upon itself to have this appeal dismissed. However, I think there is at least a reasonable basis to conclude that the Industrial Magistrate intended to, and did, finally determine the issue of principle in a binding way and that his expression at the conclusion of his reasons was intended to, and did, operate in that way. In any event, if there were any ambiguity, the Industrial Magistrate could have been asked to clarify the meaning of [39] of his reasons so as to indicate whether he intended it to be the operative judicial determination of that issue, or further, his Honour could have been asked to make such an operative judicial determination. The notice of appeal filed in the Federal Court, in the latter event, could have been allowed to stand as if that operative determination had been made at the time of the publication of the reasons and any necessary extension of time granted. No party would thereby have been prejudiced, and indeed the respondent opposed the stay motion and wanted to proceed with the appeal. I turn to consider the issue of the costs of the appeal. Section 824 of the WR Act relevantly provides: (1) A party to a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act ... must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first-mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause. (2) Despite subsection (1), if a court hearing a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act ... is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding, the court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs. (3) In subsections (1) and (2): costs includes all legal and professional costs and disbursements and expenses of witnesses."
Case18621,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Sun [2005] FCAFC 201,"Against this, s 424B(2) and s 424B(3)(b) each provide that where no period is prescribed, the information or comments are to be given within a reasonable period. Mr Potts drew attention to the power of the RRT to extend the period to respond to an invitation contained in s 424B(4). It may well be that this power can be exercised after the initial prescribed period has expired; see Minister for Immigration and Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs v Sun [2005] FCAFC 201 at [51] . 47 A difficult question of construction and reconciliation of the provisions of Div 4 of Part 7 with the privative clause in s 474 of the Act would arise if the RRT were to specify in its s 424 or 424A invitation a period of 13 days to respond, and, in the absence of a response within that period, the RRT proceeded to make a decision on the review without further action, as apparently authorised by s 424C and s 425(2)(c). 48 However, I am relieved from answering that question because of the circumstances in which the apparent breach of s 424B(2) occurred in the present case. What I have to determine is whether the breach complained of gave rise to jurisdictional error. That cannot be answered by simply posing the question of breach or no breach; it is necessary to consider whether in the particular circumstances the breach had that result. 49 I do not see how, having regard to the language of s 424B(2) or the scope of Div 4, a breach which consisted of giving an applicant more time than he or she was entitled to, could be thought to render invalid a decision given after the breach. This must be especially so where the information was provided and a hearing took place in accordance with s 425. 50 It follows that the appeal must be dismissed."

It was for his Honour to form a view as to which witnesses' evidence, whether in whole or in part, he accepted, having seen or heard them. His Honour gave reasons for preferring Mr Xiao's evidence to that of the appellant and I can discern no error in those reasons, nor has the appellant demonstrated any such error. I see no reason for disturbing his Honour's conclusion on credibility and reliability of the witnesses based on my review in exercising the appellate jurisdiction of the court of the record of the trial ( Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22 ; (2003) 214 CLR 118 at 125-129 [22] - [31] ; CSR Ltd v Della Maddalena [2006] HCA 1 ; (2006) 224 ALR 1 at 6-9 [13] - [24] per Kirby J, Gleeson CJ agreeing at 3 [1])."
Case24624,followed,SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at 47,"While it may be that a Tribunal must notify an appellant adequately of the issues to which its reasoning processes might be directed, it is not necessary and often would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to put to an applicant in so many words that he or she is lying, that he or she may not be accepted as a witness of truth or that he or she may be thought to be embellishing the account that he has given of certain events. Proceedings before the Tribunal are not adversarial and the Tribunal is not to adopt the position of the contradictor (see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] HCA 63 ; (2006) 231 ALR 592 at 47). There was no error on the part of the primary judge in his conclusions. 13 The primary judge also considered other possible jurisdictional errors on the part of the Tribunal of which there was no suggestion in the appellant's application of 12 April 2006. There is no apparent error in his Honour's observations on those matters. 14 The grounds stated in the notice of appeal are as follows: ""I do not believe that Federal Magistrates Court give me a fair judgment of my protection visa application. I am a Falun Gong member and I will be prosecuted if I go back to China. It is wrong that RRT member did not invite me to comment on any doubts she had during or after hearing. I did not have any chance to explain. RRT member also believes that my evidence seemed rehearsed without any evidence. Court should listen to the tape of RRT hearing and know what is really happening on that day."" The grounds are not helpful, but appear to be an assertion that the Federal Magistrates Court erred in failing to hold that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by not inviting the appellant to comment on doubts as to the appellant's credibility. I have already referred to that matter. 15 In any event, whether or not such an omission could constitute jurisdictional error, it does not appear to be the case here. That is to say, the reasons of the Tribunal suggest that it put in express terms to the appellant its concerns about inconsistency between his evidence and independent information. There was no error on the part of the Federal Magistrates Court. 16 The appeal should be dismissed with costs. The Minister asks for costs in the fixed amount of $3,200. While there is no evidence as to the reasonableness of that fee, I am not persuaded that it is unreasonable. In the absence of the appellant it seems to me to be appropriate to accede to the Minister's request in order to avoid unnecessary further costs. I order the applicant to pay the first respondent's costs in the sum of $3,200.

Clearly enough it predicates the existence of some kind of relationship but it leaves unspecified the plane upon which the relationship is to be sought and identified.

Case543,followed,Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606,"concept of ""reputation"" in the law of defamation comprehends all aspects of a person's standing in the community: Radio 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd v Chesterton [2009] HCA 16 ; (2009) 254 ALR 606 at 616 [36] per French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ. The importance of the law of defamation in balancing the right of an individual to the protection of his or her reputation and the right commonly described as freedom of speech plays a crucial role in our democratic system of government. That balance is affected at common law by the operation of the defence of qualified privilege as elaborated in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [1997] HCA 25 ; (1997) 189 CLR 520 , see at 565-576 per Brennan CJ, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Kirby JJ. The test does not imply that the hypothetical referees will exercise a moral judgment about the plaintiff or applicant because of what is said about him or her. Rather, the test identifies the attributes of persons who share the standards of the general community and will apply them: Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38]. And, the moral or ethical standards held by the general community may be relevant to imputations which reflect upon a person's business or professional reputation: Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]. The standard to be applied must be one common to society rather than one which reflects an attitude of a section of it: Chesterton 254 ALR at 619 [48]. French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ continued ( Chesterton 254 ALR at 618 [46]: ""In such cases the ordinary reasonable person may be expected to draw upon such community standards as may be relevant, in order to answer the question whether there has been injury to that reputation."" I am of opinion that the essential balances that will need to be struck in respect of the critical issues in this matter (other than damages) are quintessentially better determined by a jury. This assessment will best be done by the community referees to whom French CJ, Gummow, Kiefel and Bell JJ referred in Chesterton 254 ALR at 616 [37]-[38], 618 [46], 619 [48] as did Brennan J in Lamb 150 CLR at 506. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the ends of justice render it expedient to direct a trial by jury of all issues in the proceedings, other than damages and any other issue which, pursuant to the Defamation Act would not be left to the jury. Thus, the question of the capacity of the matters complained of to convey any of the defamatory meanings alleged (as opposed to whether they in fact were conveyed) would remain a question of law to be decided by a judge. The part of this controversy that arises under s 53B of the Trade Practices Act should also be decided by a jury. This is because it is inextricably related to the meanings conveyed to ordinary reasonable readers by the matters complained of and whether Ms Ra has been injured in her reputation as an employer for the purposes of s 53B. However, if the jury returned a verdict in her favour on the issues of liability, the amount of compensation to be awarded pursuant to s 82 of that Act should be assessed by a judge."

A computer program is a set of instructions designed to cause a computer to perform a particular function or to produce a particular result. A program is usually developed in a number of stages. First, the sequence of operations the computer will be required to perform is commonly written out in ordinary language.

It is not clear that this claim was pressed. In my view it is clear that the opening words of cl 24 of the terms and conditions upon which Mr Patankar was offered employment by Excom were aspirational in the sense that they merely sought to describe the attitude that would inform the way in which Excom would conduct staff performance reviews ( Whitlock v Brew [1968] HCA 71 ; (1968) 118 CLR 445 ; Bishop v Taylor [1968] HCA 68 ; (1968) 118 CLR 518).

Case2706,cited,British Broadcasting Corporation v British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd [1992] Ch 141,"It is unnecessary to compare minutely the length of time taken in these examples of other media, given the respondents' evidence as to the impugned broadcasts.

Ultimately, that will be a matter of judgment and impression, see British Broadcasting Corporation v British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd [1992] Ch 141 and Hubbard v Vosper [1972] 2 QB 84 and other cases. It is not clear to me that that judgment ought be made, that is, that there has been a taking of too much by reference to the benchmark of free to air and pay television. As I said, it is unnecessary to pursue this judgmental analysis given the way the matter has been argued. My doubts and uncertainties about whether what has been done, goes beyond fair dealing, is strengthened by some evidence concerning the approach of Telstra itself in negotiating with the Australian Football League (the ""AFL"") in December 2005. Telstra in those negotiations was seeking to reach agreement with that other sporting code about the same kind of rights that it has been able to extract by agreement from the NRL."

Case8850,cited,F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 ,"Counsel for Sanofi-Aventis submitted that enabling disclosure, not mere disclosure, is required for anticipation, citing, most recently, Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [160] [161] and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323. By way of introduction, it is worth remarking that the phrase ""enabling disclosure"" was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 , (1996) 36 IPR 438. That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the 1997 United Kingdom Act (based upon the European Patent Convention) but did not concern the question of anticipation. The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was ""supported"" by the earlier specification. That is a concept similar to, but narrower than, whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law (cf F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 ; CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1168 ; (1994) 51 FCR 260 ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274). It may be accepted that, in the case of a claim for a chemical compound by formula, in order to be valid, the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured (s 40). The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK's Application [1991] RPC 485 , to which I shall return. The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but, in my opinion, has little, if any, relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula. Indeed, it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter. For a product claim, the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it ( May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255 at 281 282). By the same token, a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty."

In that case Bryson J rejected the idea that the entitlement of witnesses to be reimbursed for their costs and expenses could be established by reference to conflicting decisions from long ago affected by a Tudor statute long since repealed. He said (35 NSWLR at 688) that the matter should be approached as one of principle and, according to principle it ""is a necessary incident of the exercise by the court of its subpoena power that the court should deal with the question of paying persons whose time and attention are involved in the exercise"". That is, the court has an inherent jurisdiction to award in favour of a witness such costs as it thinks appropriate to compensate the witness for his time and expenses incurred in compliance with a subpoena. Thus it has been said, correctly in my opinion, that the rules that fix costs for witnesses ""represent[s] but an aspect of the more comprehensive jurisdiction in respect of persons subjected to compulsion by the processes of the Court in proceedings to which they are not parties"": Re Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Selim v McGrath (2004) 48 ACSR 681, 690 per Barrett J."
Case4861,cited,NAAH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 354,"finding of the Tribunal that the sole or predominant reason for his being targeted by the Maoists was the satisfaction of a personal grudge against him was, so submits the first respondent, a finding of fact which cannot be reviewed: Peiris v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1999) 58 ALD 413 at [18]-[23]; Buultjens v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1058 at [12] and [13]. The first respondent further submits that the Court should not too readily find error in such a finding of non-satisfaction: NAAH of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 354 at [27] ; NATC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 52 at [27] . To do so, it submits, would involve the Court transgressing into merits review or finding that there was only one reasonable finding open to the Tribunal, being Convention related persecution for reason of political opinion or membership of a particular social group, notwithstanding the lack of evidence to support such an inference. Finally, it contends that there was no evidence that the Maoists in question wanted to harm the appellant because he was an agent of the state and the Court should not reconstruct those claims in a different or more articulate manner than they were put to the Tribunal: S395/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] HCA 71 ; (2003) 203 ALR 112 at [1] ; NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 at [58] ."
Case24635,cited,Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378,"A power to make an order that no legal proceedings should be instituted by a person without the leave of a judge of the Court is, however, conferred on the Court by the Federal Court Rules . One such relevant rule is O 21 r 1. In Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 (affirmed on appeal, Skyring v Ramsey [2000] FCA 774) , Sackville J upheld the validity of O 21 r 1 in its then form. His Honour regarded the rule as falling within the rule making power conferred on the court by the Parliament in s 59(1) and s 59(2)(l) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 . Order 21 r 1 has since been amended but not in any way which would call into question the continuing relevance of the conclusion reached by Sackville J. Those provisions of the Federal Court of Australia Act also support the validity of the other relevant rule, O 21 r 2. 46 So far as presently material and as at the time when the Respondent's application was heard and written submissions made, O 21, r 1 and r 2 provided: 1 Vexatious litigant (1) If a person institutes a vexatious proceeding and the Court is satisfied that the person has habitually, persistently and without reasonable grounds instituted other vexatious proceedings in the Court or any other Australian court (whether against the same person or against different persons), the Court may order: (a) that any proceeding instituted by the person may not be continued without leave of the Court; and (b) that the person may not institute a proceeding without leave of the Court. (2) An order under this rule may be made: (a) on the Court's own motion; or (b) on the application of the Attorney-General or Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or (c) on the application of the Registrar. 2 Vexatious proceeding against a person Where any person (in this rule called the vexatious litigant) habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground institutes a vexatious proceeding against any person (in this rule called the person aggrieved) in the Court, the Court may, on application by the person aggrieved, order that the vexatious litigant shall not, without leave of the Court, institute any proceeding against the person aggrieved in the Court and that any proceeding instituted by the vexatious litigant against the person aggrieved in the Court before the making of the order shall not be continued by him without leave of the Court. 47 Order 21 r 1(2) has since been amended so as to allow an application under O 21 r 1 to be made by, relevantly, ""a person against whom the person mentioned in subrule (1) has instituted or conducted vexatious proceedings"". This amendment, being procedural, would now give the Respondents a standing which they did not hitherto have to seek relief pursuant to O 21 r 1, providing, of course, that they were persons in respect of whom a vexatious proceeding had been instituted. The standing to bring an application under O 21 r 2, as the then language of that rule provided, was more accommodating for persons in the position in which the respondents allege themselves to be. 51 Discrete applications in the original jurisdiction for relief under O 21 were made in Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 , National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) [2005] FCA 1895 (Spender J) (affirmed, Freeman (a bankrupt) v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; (2006) 230 ALR 213) and Granich and Associates v Yap [2004] FCA 1567 (French J). 54 Nonetheless, I note that in Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) (2007) 242 ALR 370 Finn J entertained, but did not grant, an application made in an existing proceeding for relief under O 21 r 1 and r 2 as a sequel to a summary judgment application. Though the effect, if any, of O 21 r 3 with respect to the practice and procedure in respect of seeking to engage the powers conferred by O 21 r 1 and r 2 is not mentioned in that case, neither it must be said, is it mentioned in Ramsey v Skyring, National Australia Bank Limited v Freeman (a Bankrupt) and Granich and Associates v Yap . 58 In Kowalski v Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd) (2007) 242 ALR 370 at 380, [44], Finn J observed of O 21 r 1 and r 2: [44] By way of background to the application of these provisions, it is important to have regard to the fundamental principle on which they entrench. This is that every person has a ""constitutional right"" of access to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain redress in consequence of an alleged breach of his or her rights by some other person: Bremer Vulkan Schiffbau Und Maschinenfabrik v South India Shipping Corp Ltd [1981] AC 909 at 977 ; [1980] 1 All ER 289 at 295; Ramsey v Skyring [1999] FCA 907 ; (1999) 164 ALR 378 at 389 ; [1999] FCA 907 ; Freeman v National Australia Bank Ltd [2006] FCAFC 67 ; (2006) 230 ALR 213 at 218 19 ; [2006] FCAFC 67. The purpose of the powers given under the Rules is to reinforce the power of the court to protect its own processes against unwarranted usurpation of its time and resources and to avoid the loss caused to those who have to face actions which lack any substance: Jones v Skyring [1992] HCA 39 ; (1992) 109 ALR 303 at 312; [1992] HCA 39 ; 66 ALJR 810 at 814.

Case11024,referred to,Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe (1995) 60 FCR 99,"If legal expenses are properly treated as having been incurred by a taxpayer in defending the manner of his performance of his duties, the expenses will be deductible. If a liability is incurred, or a claim is encountered, because of the very act of performing the work by which a taxpayer earns assessable income, the expense will be deductible. If a proceeding in respect of which legal expenses are incurred arises from activities by which a taxpayer earns his income or the mode of his performance of a particular task carried out in the course of earning his income, the legal expenses incurred in relation to that proceeding will be deductible. That is to say, if the cause or the purpose of a taxpayer's incurring of legal expenses is his assertion that he had faithfully performed the duties by which he had earned assessable income, the expenditure will be deductible ( Commissioner of Taxation v Rowe (1995) 60 FCR 99 at 113 (' Rowe '). 34 If incurring costs can be shown to contribute to the success of an employee in defending himself from dismissal from his employment and costs are incurred to preserve the employee's entitlement to receive, in return for his services, assessable income, the costs will be deductible ( Rowe at 115-116). If legal expenses are incurred by an employee in defending himself from dismissal, the expenditure will be incurred on revenue account and not capital account ( Rowe at 118). Whether or not legal expenses constitute an outgoing of a capital nature or an outgoing on account of revenue depends upon the cause or the purpose of incurring the expense. It is therefore necessary to consider the object in view when the legal proceedings were undertaken or the situation that impelled a taxpayer to undertake the proceedings ( Hallstroms Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1946] HCA 34 ; (1946) 72 CLR 634 at 647)."

It addresses questions as to whether s 43 of the Lands Acquisition Act permits the compulsory acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of extinguishing native title in order to alienate land for the private benefit of another citizen; whether s 24MD of the NT Act permits the acquisition of native title rights and interests in land for the purpose of vesting the affected land in the Northern Territory freed and discharged of the native title rights and interests; and whether s 46 of the Lands Acquisition Act is repugnant to s 238 of the NT Act."
Case15851,cited,Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216,"[26], the Tribunal noted that in the absence of any variation to the contracts, the amounts that would have been deductible under s 82AAC of the Act as superannuation contributions were in 1997 $27,170.00 (Mr Mark Trail) and $9,782.00 (Mr Allan Trail) and in 1998, $28,620.00 (Mr Mark Trail) and $10,232.00 (Mr Allan Trail). At [27], the Tribunal noted that s 177C(1)(b) requires the making of an hypothesis as to what might reasonably be expected to have happened had the scheme not been entered into or carried out. The Tribunal noted the observations of Gummow and Hayne JJ in Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216 at 243 [66] that the enquiry directed by Part IVA requires comparison between the scheme in question and an alternative postulate. The Tribunal also noted that the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody [1994] HCA 43 ; (1994) 181 CLR 359 determined that a reasonable expectation requires more than a possibility with the result that the prediction must be sufficiently reliable for it to be regarded as reasonable. The matter is to be remitted to the Tribunal to determine the questions before it by applying the test so as to determine whether there is evidence which supports an hypothesis that the taxpayer would have undertaken or might reasonably be expected to have undertaken a particular activity in lieu of the scheme and whether that activity would or might reasonably be expected to have resulted in an allowable deduction of the same kind as the deduction claimed by the taxpayer under the scheme consistently with the methodology identified in the authorities and in particular, Commissioner of Taxation v Peabody (1994) 181 CLR 359; Commissioner of Taxation v Hart (2004) 217 CLR 216; and Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Lenzo (2008) 167 FCR 255 at 278 [121] to [125] and [128]; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Spotless Services Ltd (1996) 186 CLR 404."

Case15528,followed,Reg v Hunt; Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 32 ; (1979) 180 CLR 322,"In Reg v Hunt; Ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 32 ; (1979) 180 CLR 322 at 329, Mason J, with whom Gibbs J agreed at 324, explained the significance of a statutory requirement that a decision-maker ""have regard to"" costs necessarily incurred in providing nursing home care in a particular nursing home when determining a scale of fees. Mason J said that the expression ""have regard to"" required the decision-maker to take the costs into account and give them weight ""... as a fundamental element in making his determination"": Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329. He explained that in that case there were two reasons for such a construction, first, that the costs were the only matter explicitly mentioned as a matter to be taken into account and, secondly, the scheme of the provisions was that once an approval were given, the proprietor of the nursing home was not permitted to exceed the scale of fees fixed by the decision-maker. 104 As Mason J pointed out the section did not require the decision-maker there to fix the scale of fees exclusively by reference to particular costs. The decision-maker was entitled to have regard, he said, to other relevant considerations. But, the function of the decision-maker was to determine a scale of fees for the particular nursing home, not all nursing homes. Thus the Act directed that regard be had to the costs incurred in providing care in that nursing home: Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329. 105 I am of opinion that when s 152CR(1)(d) required the Commission, in making a final determination, to take into account Telstra's direct costs of providing access to the ULLS in the manner the Commission proposed, it was required to take that matter into account, together with the other matters referred to in the section, and to give weight to them as a fundamental element in making its decision: The Queen v Toohey; Ex parte Meneling Station Pty Limited [1982] HCA 69 ; (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 333 per Gibbs CJ applying what Mason J had said in Sean Investments 180 CLR at 329 to a section requiring a decision-maker to take a variety of matters into account. Mason J said that the requirement to have regard to a matter meant that it would become a central element for the decision-maker in his considerations: Meneling Station 158 CLR at 338. And, as he later explained in his classic judgment in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41, in the absence of any statutory indication of the weight to be given to various considerations, it is generally for the decision-maker and not the Court to determine the appropriate weight to be given to the matters which are required to be taken into account in exercising a statutory power. Mason J said that the Court could set aside an administrative decision which had failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or had given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, but the preferred ground on which that power was to be exercised was that the decision was ""manifestly unreasonable"". A person entrusted with a discretion must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider: Peko-Wallsend 162 CLR at 39 per Mason J applying Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1948] 1 KB 223 at 228 per Lord Greene MR. 108 Because s 152CR(1) required it to take into account each of the seven specified factors, the Commission had to give each of them appropriate consideration in arriving at its final determination. The number and variety of factors which a statute requires a decision-maker to take into account or to have regard to in arriving at a decision necessarily affects the weight any one of those factors must be given in the deliberative process. In Sean Investments [1979] HCA 32 ; 180 CLR 322 , the costs were fundamental - or foundational - because they were the only matter which the statute prescribed. The subject matter, scope and purpose of the statutory power provide a context in which to assess the duties it imposes on the decision-maker in any particular situation: cf: Foster v Minister for Customs [2000] HCA 38 ; (2000) 200 CLR 442 at 452 [22] - [23] per Gleeson CJ and McHugh J, Gaudron and Hayne JJ agreeing with their Honours at 454 [32]."
Case12280,cited,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323,"I respectfully agree with the Federal Magistrate. It is clear that the Tribunal did consider each of the issues it was required to consider for the purposes of making a decision. Section 430(1)(c) of the Act requires the Tribunal to set out the findings which it made and which it considered to be material. It does not oblige the Tribunal to make findings on every question of fact which is objectively material ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 at [9] and [67] [68]). There is no jurisdictional error in circumstances where the Tribunal has not specifically made mention of a particular piece of evidence in its reasons. As Jarrett FM said at [36], ' the case put by the [appellant] was considered, but rejected, by the Tribunal '. 35 This ground of appeal has not been established. 36 The appellant's complaint is that the Tribunal failed to identify the relevant principles for the determination of a particular social group within the meaning of Article 1A(2) of the Convention. The Tribunal did not discuss the principles of such determination. Federal Magistrate Jarrett pointed out at [38] that the appellant did not put her case on the basis that she was a member of a particular social group. The Minister concedes that the Tribunal did not follow the usual course when determining whether a group or class to which an appellant claims to belong is capable of constituting a particular social group under the Convention; namely whether there is an identifiable social group and whether the appellant is a member of such a group."
Case8526,discussed,Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656,"significance of the distinction, if legally there is one, was not made clear. It is argued that the Housing Associations could not alienate their interests in the town camps under the respective Special Purposes Leases or Crown Leases either absolutely or for 40 years. That was said to flow from the proper construction and understanding of the objects and purposes of the Housing Associations. I have already addressed that contention. No reason was put why those objects and purposes should impose restrictions on the powers of the Housing Associations which preclude their capacity to agree to the proposed subleases as Housing Associations, and different restrictions on their powers because of the interests of their members as a whole. The plurality judgment in Gambotto 182 CLR pointed out at 444 that the observations of Lindley MR in Allen v Gold Reefs of West Africa Ltd [1900] 1 Ch 656 at 671 that the power of the majority to alter the articles of association of a company must be exercised in a lawful manner and ""bona fide for the benefit of the company as a whole"" was inappropriate where the proposed resolution involved a conflict of interests and advantages. The plurality judgment said at 444: It seems to us that, in such a case not involving an actual or effective expropriation of shares or of valuable proprietary rights attaching to shares, an alteration of the articles by special resolution regularly passed will be valid unless it is ultra vires, beyond any purpose contemplated by the articles or oppressive as that expression is understood in the law relating to corporations."
Case7470,referred to,Hadjimouratis v Casanova [2005] FMCA 1468,"Federal Court is a superior court (FCA Act, s 5(2)) and therefore, whatever the nature of the defect or defects in the proceedings, the sequestration order is not void or a nullity in the sense that it is without legal effect: see Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5 ; (1944) 68 CLR 571 at 590 per Rich J; Emanuele v ASC [1997] HCA 20 ; (1997) 188 CLR 114 at 119, 120 per Brennan CJ and at 156 per Kirby J; Re Anasis; Ex parte Total Australia Ltd (1985) 63 ALR 493 at 496 and Re Fuller [1999] FCA 1811 at [13] [16] per Hill J. This principle applies to orders made by registrars of the Federal Court pursuant to the scheme of delegation of powers under s 35A of the FCA Act: Official Trustee v Nedlands [2000] FCA 599 ; (2000) 173 ALR 255 at [22] [25] per Finn J. 88 In Cameron v Cole the High Court held that the Federal Court of Bankruptcy was a superior court and Williams J, whose dissent was not on this point, said (at 607): 'When, therefore, the Federal Court of Bankruptcy has made a sequestration order under the Act, it is not, in my opinion, a nullity, so that, even if it has been irregularly obtained, it operates until it is set aside and causes the debtor to become a bankrupt and his property to vest in the official receiver...' The sequestration order in the present case is therefore, at worst, voidable and was effective to bankrupt Ms Cross when it was made. The question of whether it can truly be seen to be voidable depends upon the applicability and operation of s 306. Section 306 only applies to a formal defect or an irregularity but where that precondition is satisfied, it operates automatically: Kleinwort Benson Australia Ltd v Crowl [1988] HCA 34 ; 165 CLR 71 at 81. As the High Court said in Adams v Lambert [2006] HCA 10 ; (2006) 225 ALR 396 at [24] , the composite expression 'a formal defect or an irregularity' conveys a meaning with elements of both inclusion and exclusion. The Court went on to say (at [26]): 'The question of construction raised by the words ""a formal defect or an irregularity"" is one to be decided by reading s 306 in the context of the whole Act, informed by the general purpose of the legislation, and the particular purpose of the provisions relating to bankruptcy notices. It is similar to the question that, in former times, would be explained by asking whether a statutory requirement was mandatory or directory. In Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority it was said: ""A better test ... is to ask whether it was a purpose of the legislation that an act done in breach of [a] provision should be invalid ... In determining the question of purpose, regard must be had to 'the language of the relevant provision and the scope and object of the whole statute'"".' The High Court also held that the kind or degree of breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306 and that if a defect could cause substantial injustice, it may not easily be classified as a formal defect or irregularity: see [18], [22]. Ultimately, the characterisation of a defect as formal or substantive is a matter for judgment, however, it is first necessary to consider, as the High Court has indicated, the legislative regime in relation to, in this case, creditors' petitions. A useful starting point is the analysis of Burchett J in Re Millar; Ex parte Commonwealth Development Bank of Australia (No 388/1993, unreported, 27 April 1993), where his Honour first set out what the Full Court had said in Ginnane v Diners Club Limited (1993) 120 ALR 375 at 376: 'Paragraph 52(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act provides that at the hearing of a creditor's petition, the Court shall require proof of the service of the petition and, if it is satisfied with the proof of that service, as well as the other matters specified in sub-section 52(1), it may make a sequestration order against the estate of the debtor. Sub-section 52(2) provides, among other things, that if the Court is not satisfied with the proof of the service of the petition, it may dismiss the petition. These provisions illustrate a unique prescription relating to a petition for a sequestration order. A sequestration order affects the status of a person. The Legislature, in recognition of this feature, has insisted that the petitioner must prove, among other things, service of the petition on the debtor.' Burchett J went on to say: 'If one turns to s 52 of the Act, the force of what their Honours say is immediately apparent. It is a peculiar feature of litigation under the Bankruptcy Act , upon a creditors petition, that the court is expressly required to hear proof of service of the petition, and is expressly required, if it is not satisfied with the proof (among other things) of that matter, to dismiss the petition. It seems to me very difficult to regard s. 306 as capable of avoiding the consequences of any serious default, in respect of the requirements regarding the service of the petition so specifically stated in s. 52 , on the basis that such a serious default would be a mere formal defect or an irregularity. The requirements of s. 52 are essential requirements for the proof of the petition. They are made essential, no doubt, because the law recognises that proceedings in bankruptcy have an extraordinarily far reaching effect, not only upon the status of the debtor but also so as to convert, in some cases, actions and omissions of his in the past which at the time they were done or omitted did not constitute any offence into serious criminal offences.' It is clear from what his Honour said that having regard to the purposes of the statutory regime a serious breach of the requirements of service was intended by the legislature to lead to invalidity, in the sense that it would not constitute a mere formal defect to which s 306 would apply. This analysis echoes what the High Court said in Adams v Lambert , namely that the kind or degree of the breach is relevant to a consideration of s 306. In Re Ditfort; Ex Parte DCT (1988) 19 FCR 347, which was an application for annulment, Gummow J expressed agreement with the proposition, advanced by Walters J in Re Long; Ex parte Fraser Confirming Pty Ltd (1975) 12 SASR 130, that there is a necessity for strictness of proof in observance of the requirements for service of bankruptcy notices and bankruptcy petitions. His Honour said (at 359 360): 'Whilst not necessarily being of the view that s 306 can never apply in such a case in any circumstances, I respectfully agree with what was said by his Honour as to the importance of proper proof in these cases, and as to the salutary consequences for creditors of failure to comply with the rules...' In this case the relevant rules are, of course, the provisions of O 43 r 13 which set in place a special regime for service. The provisions of sub-rule 13(6) reflect the position in England as it became after Judicature: See, T Snow et a., The Annual Practice , 11 th edn, Sweet &amp; Maxwell, London, 1893 at 248; T W Chitty, Chitty's Archbold's Practice of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice 14 h edn, H Sweet &amp; Son, London, 1885 at 1144. The practice in Chancery before Judicature was that 'service of a copy of the bill was effected in the ordinary manner' ( Annual Practice, supra, at 248). The Rules of Court in the First Schedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (1873) 38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77 provided, relevantly in O 9 r 5: 'When a lunatic or person of unsound mind not so found by inquisition is a defendant to the action, service on the committee of the lunatic, or on the person with whom the person of unsound mind resides or under whose care he or she is , shall unless the Court or Judge otherwise orders, be deemed good service on such defendant.' (Emphasis added) In The Fore Street Warehouse Company Limited v Durrant &amp; Co. (1883) 10 Q.B.D. 471 the writ had been served on the lunatic defendant's business manager. Grove J said of the rule (at 473): 'I think the principle of this rule is that the service should be on some person qualified to act for the lunatic or most likely to know to whom the fact of service ought to be communicated. The manager of the lunatic's business might be ignorant of these matters. Where the writ is served in such a manner that it may probably never reach the lunatic, I do not think it can be valid and proper service. The plaintiffs may reasonably be required to go through the formalities which may give the friends of the lunatic a proper opportunity of appearing.' It is also useful to consider what has been said about the next step in the process contemplated by the rules, namely the appointment of a next friend or tutor. The Rules of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, and in particular those which preceded the recent uniform civil procedure regime, are in a similar form to those which operate in this Court. In State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Hammond (1988) 15 NSWLR 395 Kirby P, with whom Hope and Mahoney JJA agreed, explained (at 400) that: '... the provisions of Pt 63, r 2 [which establishes the procedural requirement of a next friend] are simply machinery or procedure provisions. They are designed, principally, to ensure that there is someone answerable to the court on behalf of the litigant, with a disability; that crucial decisions affecting that litigant can be properly and responsibly made; and that a person exists who can bear any costs as are ordered against the person with the disability at the end of the litigation.' Two features of the language of O 43 r 13 merit particular consideration. First, while the machinery provisions of O 43 r 13, namely, sub-rules (3) (6) use the word 'may', one must take into account sub-rule (2) which provides: '(2) Personal service on a person under a disability shall not be effected otherwise than in accordance with this rule.' Second, a certain tension seems to arise within the rule when ones comes to sub-rule (4), which provides: '(4) The document may be served on any person (including the person under disability) whom the Court may, before or after service , approve.' However, when one bears in mind the purpose of this rule and its place in the broader rules as to litigation involving disabled persons, there is no tension between sub-rules (2) and (4). One can readily imagine a case where the Court would approve a particular person upon whom service could be effected. Indeed, it would be a prudent course to obtain such approval in advance of proceeding against a disabled person. On the other hand, where service has taken place in breach of the rule but those who care for the disabled person nevertheless appear at Court and no injustice has been occasioned by the breach of the rules, one appreciates how the Court might approve service which has already taken place. The discretion in sub-rule (4) is premised upon the mandatory nature of the rule, as reflected in the language of sub-rule (2). Where the objects of the rule have otherwise been achieved, it facilitates the proceedings moving forward by validating service which would have otherwise been prohibited. It is also important to note that the rules expressly reject the idea that one might serve, perhaps out of an abundance of caution, both the person designated by sub-rule 13(6) and the mentally disabled person with an initiating process such as a creditor's petition. The course which is not only to be preferred but which appears to be required is to approach the Court for a grant of approval. Only in relation to the limited class of documents in sub-rule (8) is a different approach to be adopted. Thus, in their general application the special rules as to service firmly ensure that their aim is attained, namely that an opportunity is afforded to those who care for a mentally disabled person to appear before the Court and to represent and protect that person's interests where by definition he or she does not have the capacity to do so alone. The existence of a facility for the proceedings to move forward once that aim has been achieved does not detract from the control which the Court maintains over this step in proceedings against mentally disabled persons. In bankruptcy proceedings the legislature has protected all debtors by requiring proof of service of the petition in every instance. In the case of mentally disabled persons that protection extends to the requirement to serve in accordance with the special rules designed to ensure that the opportunity is a real one. In my judgment, strict compliance with the provisions of O 43 r 13 is necessary in bankruptcy proceedings. A breach of these rules could result in substantial injustice being visited upon the disabled respondent. Moreover, a serious breach could defeat the intention of the O 43 altogether and lead to a breach of the fundamental rules of natural justice. The FCR require service upon a particular person and that was not done. The FCR also prohibit service upon the disabled person and that was ignored. The conduct of the Creditor constituted a serious breach of the FCR and resulted in a defect in the proceedings which was not a formal one. Section 306 does not apply and the sequestration order is voidable. The separate question of whether substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect in these proceedings does not arise. In any event, I am of the opinion that in all the circumstances of this case substantial injustice has been occasioned by the defect which cannot be remedied by order of the Court save to set aside the sequestration order and dismiss the petition. The Annulment Issue It is quite clear that Ms Cross should not have been bankrupted. She was solvent at the time. A creditor who issues a creditor's petition runs the risk that if the debtor is solvent, the likelihood is that the petition will be dismissed with costs. The evidence suggests that Ms Cross, due to her state of mind, may have thought that the body corporate of her home unit building did not exist and that she therefore did not owe it any money. Whether that be right or not, bankruptcy proceedings are not for debtors who won't pay debts. They are for debtors who can't pay debts. As the Full Court said in Sarina v Council of the Shire of Wollondilly (1980) 48 FLR 372 at 376: 'In bankruptcy, rights of creditors to sue the bankrupt are converted into rights of proof against his estate and he is protected from suit. The avoidance of preferences, voluntary settlements and fraudulent dispositions of property by the bankrupt is intended to restore the property or money of the bankrupt to his estate to achieve a fair and rateable division of the bankrupt's property among his creditors. The bankrupt is disqualified from holding certain offices. Bankruptcy involves a change of status and quasi-penal consequences. Upon discharge from bankruptcy, the bankrupt is released form his debts subject to certain exceptions. These considerations negate the existence of any policy underlying the Act that a debtor should be made bankrupt if he is able to pay his debts but is unwilling to do so. If a debtor is able to pay his debts but is recalcitrant, his creditors may resort to the remedies otherwise afforded by the law such as execution against his property and garnishee proceedings. The words ""able to pay his debts"" in s. 52(2) of the Act do not mean ""willing and able"" to do so .' (Emphasis added) The parties are agreed that the bankruptcy should be brought to an end, the only question being how that should be achieved. By her motion, Ms Cross seeks to have the sequestration order made by the registrar on 9 August 2004 set aside. In opposing the motion, the Creditor and the Trustee contend that the appropriate course is to make an order pursuant to s 153B(1) of the Act annulling the bankruptcy. In a normal case, annulment is undoubtedly the appropriate course; but this is anything but a normal case. The matter which evokes the response on the part of the Trustee to oppose the motion is that in the case of annulment, the Trustee gets the benefit of s 154(1)(b) of the Act, namely, he may apply the property of Ms Cross still vested in him the home unit at 12/28 Tullimbar Road, Cronulla in payment of the costs, charges and expenses of the administration of the bankruptcy, including the remuneration and expenses of the Trustee; whereas, if the sequestration order is set aside, he has no such right of application. The Creditor's opposition to the setting aside of the sequestration order is no doubt sourced in the consequential orders I would make of dismissing the petition and revoking the costs order made by the registrar on 9 August 2004. At the outset, it may be said that there is no longer any third course, for example, rescission of the sequestration order: See s 37(2) of the Act; Vaucluse Hospital Pty Ltd v Phillips &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 44 at [19] and [20]. On the other hand, reviews of registrar's orders, like appeals to the Full Court, are outside the intended ambit of s 37. At the forefront of Ms Cross' case is that she was bankrupted on the first return date of a creditor's petition which was left with her while she was an involuntary patient in the Psychiatric Unit of Sutherland Hospital, but which I have found was not properly served, for a debt in respect of unpaid body corporate levies of $1,813.58, increased to approximately $2,400 by debt collection, legal and court costs of obtaining a default judgment in respect thereof; when, on the evidence before me, she owned assets in excess of half a million dollars including the home unit worth $375,000, money on deposit with major banks of more than $130,000 and shares and securities in major listed companies worth approximately $90,000. Moreover, Ms Cross was not present when the sequestration order was made. Had she, or representatives on her behalf, been present on the day, or if her circumstances and the circumstances of service of the Creditor's petition had been ventilated with the registrar on 9 August 2004 rather than being left buried in some affidavit of service, I have no doubt that the sequestration order would not have been made. Mr Bentley, in his submissions, said: 'At this point I would just like to also make this quite clear that my friend made some submissions about what happened in front of Registrar Tesoriero but that affidavit of Mr Wellmeela clearly says that she was served in a psychiatric unit. There is no hiding that, the documentation which was presented to the court clearly stated the fact. Now I presented that petition but unfortunately so long ago I can't remember what was said. I have a vague recollection that something may have been said about it but I can't recall and I am unable to assist the court or swear an affidavit so I haven't but there is no doubt that it is quite clear in evidence from Mr Wellmeela's affidavit what happened, where it happened and what was going on, so it is not as if anyone has tried to conceal this from the court or from the Registrar.' The fact is that Mr Bentley was the only person present before Registrar Tesoriero on 9 August 2004. He would not have been surprised at that. He certainly did not expect Ms Cross to be present. That he cannot remember what was said before the registrar on that day suggests to me that none of the relevant surrounding circumstances were brought to the registrar's attention because he, Mr Bentley, was blinded by an obsession to ensure that whatever else happened, Registrar Tesoriero made the sequestration order on that day. As an officer of the Court, he had an overriding duty to do more to draw to the Court's attention Ms Cross' circumstances and the circumstances under which she was purportedly served with the Creditor's petition. It is true that there has been some effluxion of time between the making of the sequestration order on 9 August 2004 and the filing of the motion on 7 November 2005. At least three things can be said about this, maybe more. First, there is no time limitation in which to bring a motion to set aside an order after it has been entered where the order has been made in the absence of a party: O35 r 7(2)(a) of the FCR, cf., s 35A(5) of the FCA Act and O 77 r 8 (now repealed) of the FCR. Second, there is a dearth of evidence as to what occurred in the period from 9 August 2004 until April 2005. It seems that the Trustee applied to become and became the registered proprietor of the home unit at Cronulla on or about 19 October 2004 but otherwise there was no administration of the bankrupt estate. The Legal Aid Commission became aware of Ms Cross' bankruptcy on or about 30 September 2004, nearly two months after she was made bankrupt. But otherwise there is no evidence as to what happened, if anything happened at all, in addition to the matters mentioned, during this period. In all the circumstances, I do not think this period should be counted as part of the effluxion of time. Third, on the evidence before me, the second period in the effluxion of time (from 11 April 2005 until 7 November 2005) was taken up by the OPC discovering the relevant evidence as to what took place, obtaining legal advice thereon and, on the basis of that advice, deciding what action was to be taken. In all the circumstances I do not find the second period so long as to militate against exercising my discretion to set aside the sequestration order rather than annul the bankruptcy. In re Daskalavski (Applicant); Ex parte The Austral Brick co Pty Ltd [1998] FCA 782 , Emmett J (in a short ex tempore judgment) concluded that, in circumstances where his Honour was satisfied that the sequestration order ought not to have been made, it was appropriate to annul the bankruptcy rather than set it aside where the estate had already been administered in bankruptcy. But that is not the case here. Only one asset of Ms Cross, her home unit at Cronulla, has been vested in the Trustee and the debt on which she was bankrupted, together with subsequent unpaid strata levies, was paid out by the OPC, not the Trustee, following the Protective Commissioner being appointed the financial manager of Ms Cross' financial affairs by order of the Guardianship Tribunal dated 11 April 2003. Notwithstanding the Trustee's claim for remuneration to 3 June 2005 ($13,990) and his anticipated claim for additional remuneration ($5,500), there was no evidence that the Trustee had been actively involved in the administration of Ms Cross' bankrupt estate. CONCLUSION When this choice as between an order that the sequestration order be set aside on the one hand and an order for annulment of the bankruptcy on the other has come before the courts on earlier occasions, the courts have consistently stressed that a balance must be struck between the rights of the applicant, who should never have been made bankrupt in the first place, and the Trustee who has simply done what the Act requires him to do: Kyriackou v Shield Mercantile Pty Ltd (No. 2) [2004] FCA 1338 at [43] per Weinberg J; followed in Capsalis v Ozdemir [2005] FMCA 1163 at [17] per Connolly FM; Hadjimouratis v Casanova [2005] FMCA 1468 at [13] and [16] per Connolly FM; and in Vaucluse Hospital Pty Ltd v Phillips at [70] and [71] per Riethmuller FM. The rights of the petitioning creditor have never been referred to as a relevant factor, and understandably so. This is not a case where the pendulum of balance tilts in favour of Ms Cross (compare Kyriackou ) as against the Trustee; on the contrary, I have come to the firm conclusion that it would be totally unfair, indeed a miscarriage of justice, for Ms Cross to be saddled with any of the relatively considerable costs of the administration of her estate. While that may involve the invocation of some injustice on the Trustee, in the circumstances of this case it seems it must be tolerated in the face of an inability of the Court to order the petitioning creditor to bear such costs: Kyriackou at [39] per Weinberg J. For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that as being the correct position, however, I do not think it is free from doubt. The powers of the Court under s 30 of the Act are expressed in extremely wide terms. In the circumstances of this case, it seems unjust to me that the Creditor only has to pay the costs of the motion even though it also loses the registrar's order as to costs of the petition. Because of the conclusion I have come to as expressed in [116] supra, I propose to exercise my discretion under O 35 r 7 of the FCR to set the sequestration order aside. In the circumstances, it is only appropriate that I summarise the matters I have taken into account in exercising my discretion to do so: 1. The inappropriateness of bankruptcy proceedings as a debt collection remedy or mechanism. Such proceedings were never intended to operate against debtors who could, but would not, for whatever reason, pay. 2. The size of the debt originally less than $2,000. 3. The aggregate value (free of encumbrances) of Ms Cross' assets closer to $600,000 than $500,000, approximately $200,000 of which were in liquid form. 4. The size of the actual and anticipated costs and expense of administering the estate: In excess of $35,000, when, on the evidence, there was minimal administration. 5. The circumstances of Ms Cross' mental condition and her admissions (once involuntarily) to the Psychiatric Unit of Sutherland Hospital during 2004 for a total of over three months. 6. My finding that Ms Cross was not properly served with the Creditor's petition. 7. The fact that she was not present or represented at the hearing at which the sequestration order was made. 8. The fact that the circumstances referred to in 5 and those underlying my finding in 6 were not ventilated before the registrar on 9 August 2004 (the first return date of the petition) when the sequestration order was made. 9. The fact that those involved in ensuring that Ms Cross was bankrupted on 9 August 2004 Messrs Meuller and Bentley were officers of the Court. The orders of the Court will be: 1. Michael Gregory Jones, trustee of the bankrupt estate of Isabell Jean Cross, be joined as a party (second respondent) to the proceeding, effective 6 December 2005. 2. The orders of Registrar Tesoriero made 9 August 2004 be set aside and the Creditor's petition dated 4 March 2004 and filed 23 March 2004 be dismissed. 3. The costs of Ms Cross and of the Trustee of the motion be paid by the Creditor on an indemnity basis.

Case3745,considered,Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 87 ALR 633,"In Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design and Developments Ltd [2006] HCA 55 ; (2006) 231 ALR 663 at 690, Kirby and Crennan JJ said at [111]: ... it is important to bear in mind the characteristics of modern litigation as recognised by Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Johnson v Johnson [(2000) [2000] HCA 48 ; 174 ALR 655] (at [13]): [13] Whilst the fictional observer, by reference to whom the test is formulated, is not to be assumed to have a detailed knowledge of the law, or of the character or ability of a particular judge, the reasonableness of any suggested apprehension of bias is to be considered in the context of ordinary judicial practice. The rules and conventions governing such practice are not frozen in time. They develop to take account of the exigencies of modern litigation. At the trial level, modern judges, responding to a need for more active case management, intervene in the conduct of cases to an extent that may surprise a person who came to court expecting a judge to remain, until the moment of pronouncement of judgment, as inscrutable as the Sphinx. In Vakauta v Kelly , Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ, referring both to trial and appellate proceedings, spoke of "" the dialogue between Bench and Bar which is so helpful in the identification of real issues and real problems in a particular case "". Judges, at trial or appellate level, who, in exchanges with counsel, express tentative views which reflect a certain tendency of mind, are not on that account alone to be taken to indicate prejudgment. Judges are not expected to wait until the end of a case before they start thinking about the issues, or to sit mute while evidence is advanced and arguments are presented. On the contrary, they will often form tentative opinions on matters in issue, and counsel are usually assisted by hearing those opinions, and being given an opportunity to deal with them. (Emphasis added). 224 In Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 87 ALR 633, after comments set out in the above observation, Brennan, Deane, and Gaudron JJ said at p 635: It seems to us that a trial judge who made necessary rulings but otherwise sat completely silent throughout a non-jury trial with the result that his or her views about the issues, problems and technical difficulties involved in the case remained unknown until they emerged as final conclusions in her or her judgment would not represent a model to be emulated. 225 According to Direction 21: The object of the Act is to regulate, in the national interest, the coming into and presence in Australia of non-citizens. To facilitate this object, the Minister has been given a discretion to ... cancel a visa where ... the visa holder does not pass the Character Test. In exercising this power, the Minister has a responsibility to the Parliament and to the Australian community to protect the community from criminal or other reprehensible conduct and to ... cancel visas held by non-citizens whose actions are so abhorrent to the community that they should not be allowed to ... remain within it. (Emphases added). 226 In my opinion, the requirement of some nexus between the visa holder and the criminal conduct suspected of the person or group with whom the visa holder has an association, is reinforced by the terms of paragraph 1.5 of Direction 21."
Case9187,considered,Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389,"The process of construction of the definition of 'service' and the expression 'use of a production process' must begin by examining the context in which the definition appears and giving the words 'presumptively the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances': Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 398 (' Agfa '), applying Maunsell v Olins [1975] AC 373 at 391. That is, the court must give the words a meaning which is consistent with the language and purpose of Part IIIA and the Act as a whole. It is important to remember that whilst for the purpose of these proceedings one focuses upon the definition of 'service', it is just that, a definition. One must consider the operative provision that incorporates that definition, and determine the purpose and ambit of the operative provisions. 168 The general rule of statutory interpretation is that words used in a statute are given their most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances. Consistent with a purposive approach to the interpretation of the expression 'use of a production process', the court would be entitled to receive expert economic evidence to assist in the interpretation of that phrase if it had a technical or specialised meaning: see, e.g. Agfa at 401; Pepsi Seven-Up Bottlers Perth Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 62 FCR 289 at 297-8; Re Michael ; Ex parte Epic Energy (WA) Nominees Pty Ltd (2002) 25 WAR 511 (' Re Michael ') at 543-544, [107].

""Confirm"" requires no explanation; ""vary"" in my opinion, means alter in part , as distinguished from discharging the entire order appealed against , and making a wholly different one; and ""reverse"", in my opinion, imports more than discharge , and means "" changed to the contrary "". (emphasis in original) In R v Industrial Court (S.A.); ex parte Mount Gunson Mines Pty Ltd (1982) 2 I.R 336 at 340, after considering The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone Mitchell J (King CJ and White J agreeing) observed: The dictionary meaning does not accord with that given by Andrews J in that there is no suggestion that the change or alteration must be a change or alteration only in part ."
Case3295,referred to,Ex parte Vine; Re Wilson (1878) 8 Ch D 364,"The policy underlying the provision was explained by the Court of Appeal in Ex parte Vine; Re Wilson (1878) 8 Ch D 364 at 366-367 where James LJ (Cotton and Thesiger LJJ agreeing) said: The general principle always has been that, until a bankrupt has obtained his discharge, all his property is divisible among his creditors. But an exception was absolutely necessary in order that the bankrupt might not be an outlaw, a mere slave to his trustee; he could not be prevented from earning his own living. On that principle the trustee could not sue for moneys due to the bankrupt in respect of his personal labour, and, if the bankrupt could sue for them only for the benefit of his trustee, he would really be without remedy. 43 In those circumstances, the kinds of action contemplated by s 60(4) and s 116(2)(g) do not assist in determining whether the right to bring this proceeding is property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. This is not a proceeding of the kind contemplated by s 60(4) or s 116(2)(g). The question must be answered by reference to whether a proceeding of the kind brought by the applicant is property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. That question must be addressed by reference to s 116(1). 44 This proceeding is for an order quashing the respondents' decision to terminate the applicant's employment by reason of a failure by the second respondent to accord the applicant procedural fairness and by the improper exercise of power."
Case14920,cited,"United States Surgical Corp v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, McClelland J, 13 October 1981)","The difficulty in Hoy's submissions is that, in the present case, the issue of election is not raised by Allphones but by Hoy itself in section K of its Statement of Claim. Allphones, in paragraph 44 of its Further Amended Defence, simply denies the allegation. Similarly, the allegation of bad faith is an issue raised by Hoy and denied by Allphones. In any event, it seems to me that the allegation of fraud puts in issue the state of mind of Hoy and not that of Allphones, and consequently it cannot be unfair or inconsistent for Allphones to retain its privilege with respect to records relating to its own state of mind. As McClelland J said in United States Surgical Corp v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd at 7 (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, McClelland J, 13 October 1981): '...before the privilege can be said to have been lost on this principle, one must at least be able to identify some element or feature of the claim made, or the evidence adduced, by the party otherwise entitled to the privilege , which would render reliance on the privilege unjust.' (Emphasis added.) 27 There is no unfairness, in my view, in maintaining the privilege claim by Allphones in these circumstances. It is not implicit in the denial of an allegation of bad faith that Allphones must in fairness make available otherwise privileged material relating to its state of mind simply because the other party has made the allegation. The position may be altered if Allphones were to positively assert and put in issue its state of mind by, for example, claiming that it had no reason to believe a certain matter existed or raising an issue of undue influence. But that is not this case. Such an allegation is the converse of this case, because Hoy, and not Allphones, has raised the issue."
Case24012,cited,Bercove v Hermes (No 2) (1983) 51 ALR 105,"The motion itself was filed in the appeal proceedings, and the question arises whether, if this were an exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the Court I, as a single judge, would have power to make an order of the kind contemplated. I think that is highly questionable. There is, nevertheless, authority for the proposition, including my own decision in Tuncak and Others v Young (1987) 14 ALD 286, and that of Hely J in NAMU of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCA 999 , and the earlier decision of Toohey J in Bercove v Hermes (No 2) (1983) 51 ALR 105 that is it open to a single judge, in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the Court and the application of the powers conferred upon judges of the Court under s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), to make an interlocutory order to ensure that an appeal to the Full Court, if successful, would not be nugatory, notwithstanding that the proceedings at first instance had been dismissed by the order of another judge of the Court."

Case15001,discussed,M18/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 127,"The appellants appealed to a Full Court of this Court. The Full Court said, in M18/2002 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 127 , at [10]-[11], as follows: ""In a notice of appeal filed on 1 December 2003, the appellant effectively repeated the ground raised before the primary judge. That is, it was alleged that the Tribunal fell into jurisdictional error by considering dated and not recent country information and the primary judge erred in not concluding that the Tribunal had fallen into jurisdictional error. For the reasons given by the primary judge, this contention is without substance."" 6 The Full Court also discussed the appellants' additional submissions, which sought to raise the 'medically unfit' ground mentioned in the draft order nisi filed in the High Court. The Court said, at [12]-[19]: ""In written submissions, the [first] appellant raised a number of additional issues. They included that she had been denied procedural fairness because she had been required to attend the hearing before the Tribunal at a time when she was medically unfit. The appellant also contended, in effect, that the Tribunal failed to take into account her mental state when assessing her evidence and, in particular, when considering the significance of her inability to name the Tamil boarders she claimed to have taken in during 1999. It is apparent from the Tribunal's reasons that the hearing was delayed for three months at the appellant's request because of a psychologist's report concerning the mental health of the appellant. That report recommended that the appellant should receive treatment for her condition in the interim. After the three months had passed, the Tribunal asked the appellant to attend a hearing on 25 May 2001 but, at the appellant's request (made on 24 May 2001) delayed that hearing until 31 May 2001. The Tribunal refused to delay the hearing for a longer period. It did so on the ground that the psychologist, although stating that the appellant still suffered from the same condition, reported that the appellant had not sought the recommended treatment. The appellant attended the delayed hearing with her legal representative. The appellant's amended application and written submissions before the primary Judge were prepared by counsel. That application and those submissions appear to have abandoned a complaint made in the draft order nisi that the appellant was denied procedural fairness (and that the Tribunal failed to follow procedures required by [the Act ] and misconceived its duty) because the hearing before the Tribunal took place when she was suffering from a mental disability. It may well be that the matter was not pursued in either the application or submissions because those advising the appellant considered a denial of procedural fairness was not a ground available under the then legislative regime. The allegation of denial of procedural fairness is not raised in the notice of appeal. However it is relatively clear the notice was prepared by the appellant without legal assistance. A full investigation of the consequences of any mental illness the appellant might have suffered at the time of the hearings before the Tribunal, would almost certainly have involved evidence being led before the primary judge. It was not."""
Case4089,referred to,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234,"Next the Authority submitted that Mr Seymour's argument was misconceived because it amounted to a collateral attack against his conviction which was impermissible ( Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234 at 240-245; NSW Bar Association v Somosi (2001) 48 ATR 562 at 577 [80]-[81] per Spigelman CJ, Sheller and Giles JJA agreeing). It was submitted that the tribunal had to accept the conviction and the essential facts, that is, the ingredients of the offences found by Buddin J. That being so, it was said that there was no need in [37] of the tribunal's reasons to engage in an evaluation process of the matters to which it there referred particularly as the Authority argued that [37] incorporated a reference to the earlier findings at [8]-[15] of the tribunal's reasons. 134 Here, the tribunal had the benefit of the judgment of Buddin J. That revealed not only matters which went to the issues under s 290(2)(c) but also to those under ss 290(2)(h), namely any other matter relevant to Mr Seymour's fitness to give immigration assistance. It would be open to the tribunal to rely, as it did in [37]-[38] on the objective facts of Buddin J's decision and sentence irrespective of the technical, legal issue which it addressed, and I have also considered, as to whether the contempt was a 'criminal offence' for the purposes of either or both of ss 290(2)(c) or 312(1)(e). Even if the contempt was not a criminal offence, I am of opinion that the tribunal did not err in having regard to the findings and conclusions of Buddin J in his judgment (cf: Minister for Immigration v SRT [1999] FCA 1197 ; (1999) 91 FCR 234 at 244-245 [42] - [48] per Branson, Lindgren and Emmett JJ)."

Now, in dealing with that question, again I say I protest against being called on only to look at some specific allegation in it; I think one is entitled to look at the whole document and see what it means taken together . Now, if you look at the whole document taken together, knowing what we now know and what the jury had before them, I suppose nobody can doubt that this was a fraudulent conspiracy .... It is said there is no specific allegation of fact which is proved to be false. Again I protest, as I have said, against that being the true test. I should say, taking the whole thing together, was there false representation? I do not care by what means it is conveyed by what trick or device or ambiguous language: all those are expedients by which fraudulent people seem to think they can escape from the real substance of the transaction. If by a number of statements you intentionally give a false impression and induce a person to act upon it, it is not the less false although if one takes each statement by itself there may be a difficulty in shewing that any specific statement is untrue.'

Case978,followed,Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564,"making of a declaration and the terms in which it should be framed are in the Court's discretion: Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 at 437-439 per Gibbs J; and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 ( 'Ainsworth' ) at 581-582 and 596-597. As a matter of substance, the dispute that AWB submitted to the Court for its adjudication was whether legal professional privilege did, or did not, attach to the documents in AWB's further revised list of privileged documents dated 7 August 2006 (as supplemented by letters from AWB's solicitors to the Court dated 25 August 2006 and 5 September 2006). In my opinion, any declarations made by the Court should reflect the final outcome of this case with certainty and precision. Moreover, it is desirable that there should be an authoritative resolution of the dispute presented to the Court. I have concluded that the Court should make a declaration, reflecting my reasons for judgment, that legal professional privilege attaches to specified documents, and does not attach to other specified documents. Declaratory relief in this form is appropriate because it determines the legal controversy that was before the Court: see Ainsworth at 582 and 596-597; and Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9 ; (1999) 198 CLR 334 at 355-356. As AWB's application makes clear, the controversy includes the question whether the documents at issue are protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege. This controversy is only likely to be quelled, completely and finally, by making a declaration in the form I propose."

The first point to note is that it was not the task of the Federal Magistrate to investigate whether documentation provided by MARA to Mr Hu was forged by the migration agent. In the circumstances of this case it was the task of the Federal Magistrate to consider whether there were grounds for an order of review of the decision of the respondent for any of the reasons set out in s 5 of the ADJR Act (cf comments of Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 94 ALR 11 at 26).

Case402,cited,Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1,"With reference to the eighth proposition, I note that the idea that the legal chose in action is held on trust after the consideration is paid in full is well accepted in the case law; see for example, the Australian cases Palette Shoes Pty Ltd v Krohn [1937] HCA 37 ; (1937) 58 CLR 1 at 26 27 and McIntyre v Gye (1994) 51 FCR 472 at 480 481, and the cases referred to in Meagher RP, Heydon JD and Leeming MJ, Meagher Gummow and Lehane's Equity Doctrines and Remedies (4 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6-050]. The operative principle is that equity regards as done that which ought to be done, the assignor's conscience being bound to that end: Holroyd v Marshall (1862) 10 HLCas 191 (11 ER 999); Tailby v Official Receiver (1888) 13 App Cas 523. There is, however, criticism of descriptions of the purchaser's equitable interest between contract and payment of the purchase money as that of a beneficiary under a trust; see for example Heydon JD and Loughlan PL, Cases and Materials on Equity and Trusts (6 th ed, Butterworths, 2002) at [6.7], [6.16] [6.18]. Dr Tolhurst goes further and suggests (op cit, [4.07]) an ""assignment analysis"" according to which, even in the former class of case (where the consideration for the assignment has been paid), a trust of the legal chose is unnecessary except as a remedial device granted by the court. In such a case, however, the case law is all one way in favour of a constructive trust arising as a matter of substantive law. In any event, his Lordship's evidence to that effect was not challenged."
Case16471,cited,Dufty v City Mutual General Insurance Ltd [1977] Qld R 94,"There is an undated note taken by Mr Watson of a discussion with an officer of the insurer: Therefore, there is a requirement to work if capable. If the insured person returns to work at a reduced capacity, the income protection is replacement income (business related income). If expenses exceed other business income (ie ignoring the Income Protection benefit itself) then to sell off the business is against the intent of the insurance act and the insurance company would cease benefit until other work was obtained. In a practical sense, Mr Watson should take reasonable steps to ""mitigate his loss"". That obligation is one applicable to the measure of damages in all contracts. It does not apply as a term of the policy. Section 13 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 (Cth) implies a term that each party to an insurance contract will act towards the other party with the utmost good faith. It could be expected that Mr Watson should therefore act reasonably in relation to the business activities or employment which he chooses to undertake: Dufty v City Mutual General Insurance Ltd [1977] Qld R 94. The element of reasonableness is also explained in cases such as Fidelity and Casualty Co of New York v Mitchell [1917] AC 592 ; Pocock v Century Insurance Co Ltd [1960] 2 Ll Rep 150; and Sergent v GRE (UK) Ltd [2000] Ll Rep 1R 77. That obligation extends to an insurer in determining whether an insured was totally and permanently disabled: see Beverley v Tyndall Life Insurance Co Ltd (1999) 10 ANZ Ins Cas 61-453. Reference may also be made to regs 17 and 18 of the Insurance Contracts Regulations 1985 (Cth) and to the decision in QBE Insurance Ltd v Jande (1995) 8 ANZ Ins Cas 61-270.

Case16866,cited,PhotoCure ASA v Queen's University at Kingston [2005] FCA 344 ; (2005) 216 ALR 41,"a purposive approach to construction of the claims does not mean that clear limitations in the scope of the monopoly contained in the language of the claims can be avoided or the reach of the monopoly extended beyond the clear limits of the language selected. A purposive approach to construction as opposed to a purely literal one will raise the question of whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with the descriptive words or phrases used in a claim was intended to be an essential requirement of the invention. If so, as a matter of construction, a variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed even though it could have no material affect on the way the invention works. That question does not arise where the variant would in fact have a material affect upon the way the invention works ( Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 ; Kirin-Amgen Inc. v Hoechst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444).

Case23177,cited,Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93,"BHPB relies on what it describes as a Calderbank letter (after Calderbank v Calderbank [1976] Fam 93) , which it served on Cosco's lawyers before the trial. The relevant parts of the Calderbank letter read: ""[I]n a genuine attempt to resolve its dispute with both Cosco and [Seawise, the second respondent], our client would be prepared to accept the total of US$725,000 plus interest and costs as follows: (a) as to Cosco: US$550,000 (plus interest and costs to be agreed or otherwise taxed); (b) as to [Seawise]: US$175,000 (plus interest, and costs to be agreed or otherwise taxed). Clearly this figure represents a considerable reduction of our client's principal claim, and we would encourage your client to take advantage of this opportunity to resolve the claim promptly and in its entirety. Further, should Cosco and [Seawise], as between themselves, consider that a different division of the total amount of US$725,000 plus interest and costs occur, we would invite you to deal with that as you may see fit, provided the total of our client's offer is met."" For good reason BHPB was seeking to compromise its claims against both respondents. For that it wanted a total of US$725,000 plus interest plus costs. Accordingly, BHPB made an offer that could only be accepted by both respondents unless one agreed to pay the full claim with interest and costs, and the other respondent agreed to waive any claim for costs. According to the Calderbank principle, indemnity costs will not be ordered if a party acted reasonably in rejecting the Calderbank offer. Cosco's rejection of BHPB's Calderbank offer was reasonable. A party will be acting reasonably in rejecting a Calderbank offer if the offer is unclear or imprecise. In this case, BHPB's offer was imprecise in some respects. The offer did not specify a rate of interest, in circumstances where the applicable rate was open to argument. More importantly, it is unclear whether the offer was being made to Cosco alone, or Cosco and Seawise jointly. The offer appears to have been addressed to Cosco alone, but refers to both Cosco and Seawise making payments. If the offer was made to both Cosco and Seawise jointly, then this raises a further problem the offer was incapable of acceptance by Cosco alone. BHPB is not entitled to charge one offeree with indemnity costs for not having accepted an offer that was incapable of acceptance by that offeree alone. BHPB also seeks indemnity costs by reason of the abandonment by both respondents on the first and second days of the trial of several contentions raised in their respective defences on which BHPB had gone to the trouble of obtaining expert evidence from two lawyers. The particular contentions were that BHPB had failed to exercise rights of lien and possession with the consequence that it was the author of its own loss. These allegations made it necessary for BHPB to call expert evidence on English law (the law of the charterparty) and Thai law (the place where the Global Hawk was to discharge its cargo). The abandonment of part of the defence is not, without more, the occasion to award indemnity costs in respect of those costs which, in the event, have been unnecessarily incurred. Indemnity costs might be justified if the abandoned contentions were hopeless. That, however, is not what is argued here. What happened in this case was that BHPB filed the relevant expert reports around a month or so prior to the trial commencing. When BHPB's case in respect of the abandoned contentions was fully laid out, the respondents realised they could not meet it. So, by abandoning aspects of their respective defences, the respondents saved BHPB incurring unnecessary trial costs as well as saving court time. They should not be punished for that. Accordingly, up to the point where BHPB filed the expert reports, indemnity costs are clearly not warranted. Whether indemnity costs should be paid in respect of costs incurred after the filing of expert reports is more difficult. The respondents took more than a month after receiving the expert reports to indicate they were abandoning the contentions. During that period, BHPB may have incurred further costs regarding the abandoned contentions (although these costs may have been ameliorated by the fact that the experts were to give oral testimony via videolink). On balance, I consider that the respondents' delay in indicating their intentions to BHPB was not so great as to warrant the award of costs on an indemnity basis."

In my view, each retiree had an equitable interest in the land by reason of the fact that each was entitled to specific performance of the Contract of Sale or Agreement for Sale of Real Estate or the Deed of Agreement to the possession of the property as a tenant immediately upon settlement. The extent of that interest is to be determined by the form in which specific performance would be granted by a court. The retirees were entitled as against MFLPH to an order requiring MFLPH to sign and deliver to the retirees upon settlement a lease of the property upon the terms agreed, relevantly for life, subject to the condition that the retiree stay in possession for a certain period and pay the nominal rent (see Downie v Lockwood [1965] VR 257; Craddock Bros v Hunt [1923] 2 Ch 136; Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd (1989) 168 CLR 242; Tanwar Enterprises Pty Ltd v Cauchi (2003) 217 CLR 315 at 332-333, [53]; Black v Garnock [2007] HCA 31 ; (2007) 230 CLR 438 at 449-450, [32] ). It is not necessary that specific performance be available at the time of the hearing: Bunny Industries Ltd v FSW Enterprises Pty Ltd [1982] Qd R 712. It is important to appreciate that the availability and the nature of specific performance is a precondition to the recognition of an equitable interest and the extent of that equitable interest in the property. Here, as I have said, a court, by reference to the terms of agreement between the retirees and MFLPH, would give each retiree possession of the land upon settlement by making an order that MFLPH sign and deliver a lease of the property to each retiree effective from the moment of settlement. First, the retirees argued that their entering into possession pursuant to an agreement to grant a lease and paying rent will give rise to a common law tenancy, citing Chan v Cresdon Pty Ltd [1989] HCA 63 ; (1989) 168 CLR 242. In that case, Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and McHugh JJ stated (at 248): It is well settled that entry into occupation followed by payment of rent under an agreement for a future lease brings into existence a common law tenancy from year to year, so long as the payment of rent is referable to a yearly tenancy, as where it is for an aliquot part of a year..."
Case3673,cited,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"An administrative decision made on the basis of no evidence is invalid: Sinclair v Mining Warden at Maryborough [1975] HCA 17 ; [1975] 132 CLR 473 per Barwick CJ at 479-480, Gibbs J at 483, Stephen J at 485, Murphy J at 488; Mason CJ in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321 at 358; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v SGLB [2004] HCA 32 ; [2004] 207 ALR 12 at [39] - [41] . This may be contrasted with a decision against the evidence or the weight of the evidence, which does not form the basis of jurisdictional error: Collins v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 601. 34 In view of my decision with respect to evidence in this case, it is not strictly necessary for me to consider the alternative issues raised by the appellant with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness and irrationality and want of logic of the Tribunal's decision. However, I note the findings of his Honour below that reasoning of the Tribunal was neither illogical nor irrational and, having reviewed the decision of the Tribunal, consider that there is no error in his Honour's findings in relation to these contentions. In any event, these grounds do not appear to support claims of jurisdictional defect in terms of Australian law. In particular, I note the decision of the Full Court in Andary v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2003] FCAFC 211 with respect to Wednesbury unreasonableness, and the decisions of the High Court in Bond 170 CLR (particularly per Mason CJ at 356 with whom, on this point, Brennan, Toohey and Gaudron JJ agreed) and the Full Court in VWST [2004] FCAFC 286 that want of logic does not form a valid basis of judicial review."

The Tribunal assessed the appellant's claims and set out its reasons why it did not accept them in the first respondent's submission, there can be no suggestion that the Tribunal is required to act otherwise. Additionally, the first respondent submitted that a finding on a credibility issue that was open to the Tribunal on the material before it does not give rise to an error of law: see Mashyekhi v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2000] FCA 321 ; (2000) 97 FCR 381 and W148 v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2001) 185 ALR 703."

Case12812,cited,Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163,"course, if Dornan is correct then, additionally, the Tribunal made an error of law. However, the significance of that for present purposes hinges upon whether that conclusion would lead to a different result. Clearly, such an approach would require the Tribunal to produce its reasons again. The difference would be that, if the error of law were jurisdictional the orders of the Tribunal might be set aside, it might have to re-exercise its powers afresh and it might have to do more than just produce reasons. I think it is unlikely that the error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could be jurisdictional. It is true, no doubt, that generally, an error of law will, in the hands of a non-judicial tribunal, be jurisdictional: Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179 per Brennan, Deane, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. However, it is to be noted that the errors of law there identified as having that effect were said to be those causing an inferior tribunal to identify the wrong issue. It may be doubted whether an error of law constituted by inadequate reasons could ever have that effect for reasons explained in Yusuf ."
Case12407,cited,McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639,"ASIC also sought an order that the costs be paid forthwith: O 62 r3(3) of the Federal Court Rules . In support of its application, ASIC referred to the fact that additional costs had been incurred in making arrangements for Mr Blackburn to give his evidence from Peru. The principles which govern the exercise of the discretion under O 62 r 3 were set out by Branson J in Life Airbag Company of Australia Pty Ltd v Life Airbag Company (New Zealand) Ltd (22 May 1998, unreported) and Allstate Life Insurance Co v Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No.14) (Lindgren J, 18 August 1995, unreported) as cited in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1639 at [13] [20]. The effect of those cases is to suggest that courts will depart from the general rule and order payment forthwith principally where final judgment is ""far away"" and thus the eventuality of payment is remote. Consistent with those authorities, it is inappropriate in this case to order payment forthwith of the costs thrown away. The trial is now set for September, and final resolution of the proceeding is therefore not too far away. Moreover, the costs incurred were not quantified and the plaintiff is ASIC, a government entity with sufficient funding to meet its costs in the interim. 25 Accordingly, I will order that MPG pay ASIC's costs thrown away but make no order for immediate payment or taxation.

Indeed the rights of the proposed party have not yet come into existence. What is proposed, however, is that the rights of the new trustee will substitute for the rights of the existing trustee, which do extend back to the date on which proceedings were commenced. 45 A new trustee may by registered deed be appointed in place of a trustee (s 6(1) Trustee Act 1925 (NSW) (' Trustee Act ')). Section 6(8) provides that a new trustee appointed under this section may in all respects act as if the new trustee had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument creating the trust.

Case1127,distinguished,"Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA","In summary, the applicant submits that the AAT misapplied the term ""own use or benefit"" within the context of s 8(1). In particular: &#8226; The phrase does not call for an assessment as to whether a person can in fact use the earnings as they wish or benefit from the earnings in an absolute sense. &#8226; The fact that the money may be earmarked to meet a particular obligation does not detract from the fact that the money is for the person's own use or benefit: Kear v Secretary, Department of Social Security [1998] 1087 FCA. &#8226; The fact that the repayments were made in respect of tasks performed by the respondent and made to the same entity who paid her wages seems to have clouded the issue. The situation is analogous to an employee who is found liable to the employer for damages for negligence arising out of the employee's actions in the workplace: even if the damages awarded were deducted from wages of the employee it could not be said that the employee's earnings were the lesser sum after the deduction of the damages award. &#8226; The circumstances surrounding the payment by the respondent and later reimbursement of $1,300 highlights the error in the AAT's approach. &#8226; The AAT appears to have been influenced by the fact that the applicant was unable to identify a benefit to the respondent from the amounts of the shortfalls. This is clearly an irrelevant consideration as the Act provides for the alternative of ""use or benefit"". The respondent in this case clearly used the amounts to meet her obligations. In any event the respondent did benefit from such amounts in that her superannuation entitlements were calculated on the basis of her gross earnings without deduction for the shortfalls as was apparent from the Employee Payment Summary provided by her employer. 14 In summary, the respondent submitted: 1. So-called questions of law 1, 5 and 6 specified in the notice of appeal are not, in fact, questions of law. 2. The AAT correctly recognised that the key question is whether the whole of the respondent's nominal gross wages can be said to be ""income"" as that term is defined for the purposes of s 8 of the Act . Expressed alternatively, could the amount of the withheld shortfall be said to be earned, derived or received by her for her own use or benefit? 3. The phrase ""for the person's own use or benefit"" entails the notion of a person being able to use property or income as the person wishes or sees fit, as opposed to being obliged to apply the property or income in a particular way. The respondent was never able, at the time of earning, derivation or (constructive) receipt to use the whole of her nominal gross wage as she wished or saw fit. Rather, to the extent of any shortfall, her employer was contractually entitled to withhold the amount of that shortfall from that gross wage and the respondent was obliged to accept that such an amount could be so withheld. 4. The words ""without any reduction"" which appear in s 1072 of the Act qualify only ""income"" as defined, namely the income earned, derived or received for the person's own use or benefit . 5. Reference by the applicant to the sum of $1,300 later received by the respondent by way of refund from her employer is a distraction as the appeal is unconcerned with that sum, although it will be relevant in any recalculation by the applicant of the amount, if any, of any overpayment of benefit. In any event, the AAT correctly regarded that sum as ""ordinary income"" for the purposes of the Act . 15 Appeals from the AAT are not appeals in the strict sense as they lie within the original jurisdiction of the Court. A party to a proceeding before the AAT may appeal to the Court from any decision of the AAT in that proceeding, but only on questions of law: s 44(1) Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). 47 It is for the same reason that I find distinguishable from these facts the decision in Kear [1998] 1087 FCA where Heerey J held that the relevant money received by the applicant in that case was ""his own money to deal with as he saw fit"" notwithstanding that the applicant had other commitments or arrangements for which that money was earmarked."
Case7755,cited,McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134,"Full Federal Court in McDermott Industries (Aust) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2005] FCAFC 67 ; (2005) 142 FCR 134 at 143 (Hill, Sundberg and Stone JJ) summarised the principles applicable to the construction of DTAs in this way: Double tax treaties are bilateral treaties entered into between two states. As such they are to be interpreted in accordance with the requirements of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969, entered into force on 22 January 1974) (the Convention) and in particular Art 31 of the Convention. The application of the Convention has been discussed by McHugh J in Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225 and in Thiel v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1990] HCA 37 ; (1990) 171 CLR 338 , the latter case being concerned with the interpretation of the double taxation agreement between Australia and Switzerland. The leading authority in this Court on interpretation of double taxation agreements is [ Commissioner of Taxation v Lamesa Holdings BV (1997) 77 FCR 597]. It is unnecessary here, to set out again what is there said. The following principles can be said to be applicable: Regard should be had to the ""four corners of the actual text"". The text must be given primacy in the interpretation process. The ordinary meaning of the words used are presumed to be ""the authentic representation of the parties' intentions"": Applicant A . The courts must, however, in addition to having regard to the text, have regard as well to the context, object and purpose of the treaty provisions. The approach to interpretation involves a holistic approach. International agreements should be interpreted ""liberally"". Treaties often fail to demonstrate the precision of domestic legislation and should thus not be applied with ""taut logical precision""."
Case4302,referred to,Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 69 ALR 305,"First, it is not a matter of focusing only on the last job the veteran had, or indeed on any particular job; rather, the phrase 'remunerative work that the veteran was undertaking' refers to the type of work the veteran was undertaking or his field of remunerative activity: Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 69 ALR 305 at 402; Starcevich v Repatriation Commission (1987) 18 FCR 221 at 225 per Fox J; Doig v Repatriation Commission (unreported, Federal Court of Australia, Lindgren J, 18 December 1996); Flentjar v Repatriation Commission (supra) at 4. 39 In view of the last point, some general matters about the scope and operation of s 24(1)(c) should be noted. First, under s 24(1)(c), the veteran must, by reason of the incapacity from the war-caused injuries alone, be prevented from continuing to undertake remunerative work. It is clear from the authorities that other words should not be substituted for the word 'alone', and the issue is to be approached in a practical, common-sense, fashion. In Cavell v Repatriation Commission (1988) 9 AAR 534, Burchett J said (at 538-539): 'I was referred to the Tribunal decision of Davies J, then President of the Tribunal, in Re Easton and Repatriation Commission (1987) 6 AAR 558 at 570-571. Davies J there cited passages from Banovich v Repatriation Commission (1986) 6 AAR 113, Lucas v Repatriation Commission (1986) 6 AAR 122, and Re Apthorpe and Repatriation Commission (1986) 9 ALN N157, a Tribunal decision, each of which emphasises that what must prevent the veteran from continuing to undertake remunerative work, in order to satisfy par (c), must be the war-related incapacity, and that incapacity alone. As was pointed out in Lucas 's case (supra), that means it must be relevant to determine whether the applicant would, in any event, have been debarred from work because of a factor such as age. But Davies J went on to say: ""I would not, however, substitute for the word ""alone"" the description ""sole, unique and absolute cause"" as stated in Re Repatriation Commission and Cavell (unreported, No 2891, 19 September 1986) ... . In the absence of ambiguity, other words should not be used in place of the words used by the legislation."" With respect, I entirely concur in the comment made by Davies J. This is not to say, of course, that a paraphrase may not throw light into a dark corner of a statutory prescription. But the phrase used by the Tribunal to which objection is taken, involves an almost scholastic insistence upon analysis of the concept of singularity. The tendency of that is to distract the Tribunal from its true task to make a practical decision whether the veteran's loss of remunerative work is attributable to his service-related incapacities, and not to something else as well. It is a decision that should not be made upon nice philosophical distinctions, but with an eye to reality, and as a matter in respect of which common sense is the proper guide.'"

In George v Rockett [1990] HCA 26 ; (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112 the High Court said that: ""When a statute prescribes that there must be ""reasonable grounds"" for a state of mind including suspicion and belief it requires the existence of facts which are sufficient to induce that state of mind in a reasonable person."" Later in its joint judgment the Court continued (at 116): ""The objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists: the assent of belief is given on more slender evidence than proof. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting, a proposition and the grounds which can reasonably induce that inclination of mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture."""
Case18150,cited,Hughes v Western Australian Cricket Association (Inc) (1986) 8 ATPR 40-748,"The power of the Court to make orders for costs derives from s 43 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). A successful litigant is ordinarily entitled to an award of costs: see, e.g., Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 97 per McHugh J (dissenting in result) and 120-1 per Kirby J. The power to make orders for costs is, however, discretionary, although it ""must be exercised judicially and not against the successful party except for some reason connected with the case"": see Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) [2001] FCA 1865 ; (2001) 115 FCR 229 ("" Ruddock v Vadarlis (No 2) "") at 234 per Black CJ and French JJ.

Case12428,applied,Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394,"On 30 March 2006, Haritopoulos Pty Ltd also issued proceedings under s 39B of the Judiciary Act in this Court (matter SAD 54 of 2006) against the respondent for orders that certain notices of assessment of income tax against it were invalid as not having been made in good faith and having been made for an improper purpose. In particular, Haritopoulos challenged the validity of an assessment issued on 8 November 2005 in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2002 by which Haritopoulos was assessed for income tax liability at $2,813,000 (plus certain other amounts to which I do not need to refer), and the validity of an assessment issued on 24 November 2005 imposing a penalty assessment of $2,109,750. On 25 May 2006, the respondent applied to summarily dismiss that application. The motion was heard on 29 August 2006. Judgment was given on 23 March 2007. Justice Besanko found that, on the material before the Court, Haritopoulos had no arguable case that the assessment challenged was made in bad faith and entered summary judgment dismissing the proceeding in its entirety: Haritopoulos Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 394. 13 In each of the proceedings heard by Finn J and Besanko J, the nature of the allegations is very similar to those now asserted in the statement of claim filed on behalf of the applicant in this matter. 14 Counsel for the applicant acknowledged that, unless the applicant is given leave to amend its statement of claim to add what is called a new issue, and to rely on an affidavit of Pantelis Charitopoulos sworn on 29 May 2007 in opposition to the motion, the Court would on the motion make an order dismissing the application because the issues raised on the present statement of claim are in essence the same as those already addressed. 19 Taking facts alleged in the present statement of claim at their highest, the issues which might point to invalidity of the assessment and of the penalty assessment are the same as those which Besanko J addressed in Haritopoulos [2007] FCA 394. They are a failure to provide particulars of the assessment and of the penalty assessment; secondly, the issue of the assessment on 15 September 2005 when, a few weeks earlier, an officer of the respondent had anticipated that it would take six to eight weeks for a default assessment to issue; thirdly, the fact that the penalty assessment was issued so close in time to the assessment; and finally, the failure to consider the package of information provided on 3 November 2005 before making the assessment (although it is clear that there was no undertaking given to consider that material before making the assessment, and in fact it was made plain on 20 October 2005 and in the letter of 8 November 2005 that a default assessment would issue notwithstanding the provision of that further information). 20 I agree with Besanko J, for the reasons his Honour gave, that on those allegations no arguable case of bad faith on the part of the respondent in making the assessment or the penalty assessment could be made out. As so much has been acknowledged by counsel for the applicant, I do not need to repeat those reasons. Furthermore, although it has not been expressly stated in this application, I note that Besanko J also rejected the further contention that arguably there had been a breach of s 166 of the 1936 Act and in any event his Honour found it beyond argument that s 175 meant that any such breach would not affect the validity of the assessment. His Honour also noted (as appears also to be the case here) that the claim based upon a want of procedural fairness had not been pursued before him, and in any event it was unarguable as ss 175 and 177 would operate so as not to affect the validity of the assessment even if there had been a want of procedural fairness to which the applicant was entitled. In the light of those provisions, Besanko J concluded, and I agree, that the applicant was bound to confine its challenge (as distinct from any challenge to the amount of the assessment under Pt IVC of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth)) to the ""Hickman grounds"" ( R v Hickman; Ex parte Fox and Clinton [1945] HCA 53 ; (1945) 70 CLR 598 per Dixon J at 615), relevantly that the assessment was not made in good faith."

Case24782,followed,Admiralty Commissioners v SS Susquehanna [1926] AC 655,"In the Hebridean Coast [1961] AC 545 at 576-578, Lord Reid applied there principles to a case where a government corporation claimed damages for the detention of a nonprofitearning vessel while she was being repaired. His Lordship distinguished this from the case of a profit-earning ship where the plaintiff had to prove '... the probability that she would have earned so much money if her owner could have used her' ([1961] AC at 577). With a nonprofit-earning ship, if no harm were proved apart from the mere fact that the owner is deprived of her services during the period of repairs, the Court awards damages based on interest and depreciation on the value of the ship ([1961] AC at 578 per Lord Reid, 580 per Lords Morton of Henryton and Tucker, 583 per Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest; The Greta Holme [1897] AC 596).

Case20282,affirmed,SZIUE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1551,"the grounds of appeal nor the submission filed prior to the hearing on behalf of the appellant isolate any appealable error in the decision of the Federal Magistrate from which the appeal is brought ( SZIUE v Minister for Immigration &amp; Anor [2006] FMCA 1551). Rather, there is a repetition of complaints made in the proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court concerning the proceedings of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal). Each of those complaints was properly considered and disposed of in a reasoned decision by Scarlett FM. Having read the comprehensive submissions of counsel for the Minister I would be content to simply say that no basis has been put forward to demonstrate any error in the reasons of the Federal Magistrates Court."
Case4329,cited,SZEEU v MIMIA [2006] FCAFC 2,"In considering the Tribunal's decision in light of the claims made by the appellant, Nicholls FM found that the letter of 15 January 2005 from the President of Jatiya Party was provided by the appellant for the purpose of the review and falls within the exception of s 424A(3)(b) of the Act . It was the appellant's lack of credibility which made the Tribunal unable to give weight to the document, as distinct from information about the prevalence of document fraud in Bangladesh. Findings in respect of the credibility of the appellant were matters for the Tribunal: McHugh J in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; ex parte Durairajasingham [2000] HCA 1 ; (2000) 168 ALR 407 at 423. However, even if the Tribunal had relied on the prevalence of document fraud in Bangladesh it would fall within the exception of s 424A(3)(a) of the Act . His Honour found that there was no statutory obligation of the Tribunal to provide an opportunity to the applicant to comment on the these adverse findings of the Tribunal, as such adverse findings are not ""information"" for the purposes of s 424A ( SZEEU v MIMIA [2006] FCAFC 2 at [20] , [28]). 13 In relation to the claims of a denial of procedural fairness at common law, Nicholls FM noted that the Tribunal in its decision said it had alerted the applicant to country information as to the prevalence of document fraud in Bangladesh. Similarly, the Tribunal had drawn attention to the fact that it could give not weight to the documents because of the adverse view it had taken of the appellant's credibility. In the absence of evidence provided by the applicant, the Court was unable to accept a submission of the applicant challenging these statements of the Tribunal. 14 In response to the claims of the appellant at the hearing that he was a politician, not a dentist, and that he was denied another hearing to prove this, Nicholls FM found that the applicant's request for another hearing was in response to the letter of the Tribunal and must be seen in that context. The Tribunal complied with its statutory obligations under s 425 of the Act . To the extent that natural justice in the context of Tribunal hearings is addressed exhaustively in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Act , any complaint of a denial of natural justice at common law could not succeed. However even if s 422B did not operate, the Federal Magistrate asserted such a claim still would not succeed in these circumstances."
Case24500,cited,SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886,"Only where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so will leave be granted to argue a ground of appeal abandoned in a lower court: see O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at [319] ; Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at [7] . In NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51 at [163] Madgwick J adopted the approach taken by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ in VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [48] where their Honours said: 'The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where however there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused.' This principle has been followed more recently in SZFIR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 424 and SZEPN v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 886. 21 Thirdly, the particular circumstances of this case are such that refusal to grant leave may lead to serious consequences for an appellant seeking asylum as considered in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543 at 548 and in SZEPN [2006] FCA 886 [16]. 22 The merits of the proposed ground of appeal is also a significant consideration in determining whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice to grant leave: see SZEPN [2006] FCA 886 [17] per Branson J; VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [177] - [178] ; IYER [2000] FCA 1788 per Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ at [22]-[24]; and Gomez 190 ALR at [548]. In SZCIJ [2006] FCAFC 62 the Full Court refused to grant leave to amend a notice of appeal for two reasons, one reason being that the appellant disavowed the ground sought to be raised in the Federal Magistrates Court. However the more fundamental reason was that leave to amend would be futile since the ground sought to be relied upon lacked merit."

Case16369,referred to,Australian Federal Police Commissioner v Propend Finance Pty Ltd (1997) 188 CLR,"The privilege asserted is legal advice privilege, which protects confidential communications between a client and his or her legal adviser. The protection of communications passing between third parties and the client's legal adviser does not arise in the present case: all the documents in question are said to be communications created by the OWS or Mr Ronson as State Manager of the OWS (the client) and communicated to the Legal and Advice Branch (the legal adviser). The relevant communications in respect of which privilege is claimed are all contained in documents. Therefore, in determining whether the communications enjoy the privilege claimed, the relevant test to be applied in each case is whether the document was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [1999] HCA 67 ; (1999) 201 CLR 49. Although no submissions were put directly on the point, it appears from the applicant's list of documents that several of the documents may be copies of documents which, in their original form, are not the subject of privilege. Whether these copy documents enjoy legal professional privilege will depend upon whether the copy was brought into existence for the dominant purpose of obtaining legal advice: Australian Federal Police Commissioner v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501."
Case14304,cited,AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234,"It is well recognised that a claim of legal professional privilege will not be upheld if the party resisting the claim for legal professional privilege can show reasonable grounds for believing that the communication effected by the document for which privilege is claimed was made for an illegal or improper purpose: Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501; Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500; and see generally AWB Ltd v Cole (No 5) [2006] FCA 1234 at [211] - [219] .

Case24551,considered,Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) and Another; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437,"The submissions made on behalf of the Commissioner were to the following effect: (1) There was no denial of procedural fairness by the Tribunal for the following reasons: (a) It was squarely put to Mrs Montgomery who had reconstructed the Price Spreadsheets that she had 'fabricated' or 'massaged' or 'fiddled' the figures in the Price Spreadsheets. (b) The Tribunal in reviewing a decision is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence and must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case. In those circumstances, the rule in Browne v Dunn has no application. (c) The Tribunal was entitled to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions where it was obvious that information had been omitted or falsely inserted, in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn. (d) In relation to one subject matter, 3D was invited by the Tribunal during closing submissions to re-open its case and call further evidence. It was clearly open to 3D to seek leave to recall Mrs Montgomery in order to overcome any perceived deficiency in the opportunity she had been afforded, when first cross-examined, to explain discrepancies in the relevant documents. 3D did not seek such leave. The substance of the fabrication was put to Mrs Montgomery (2) 3D has submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness because it is alleged the specific detail of the Commissioner's analysis of the Price Spreadsheets, which forms Annexure A to the Tribunal's reasons for decision, was not put to Mrs Montgomery. The Tribunal referred to this submission but found it to be without substance. (3) From the commencement of the audit and in the hearing before the Tribunal, the Commissioner had directly challenged the story put forward as to the existence of MSH and Mr Borg. It was manifest that any documentation put forward by the taxpayer in support of that story was also under challenge. (4) The Commissioner's challenge to the Price Spreadsheets was also fully appreciated by 3D. So much is clear from paras 14 and 15 of the Submissions of the Applicant dated 1 June 2007 which were provided to the Tribunal before the Commissioner made the submissions of which 3D presently complains. (5) It is significant that notwithstanding the opportunity to do so in submissions in reply, 3D made no submissions about the fabrications in the Price Spreadsheets, but merely confined its complaint to what was said to be a denial of procedural fairness. Indeed, 3D could not possibly have had an answer to the fabrications, which were apparent on the face of the Price Spreadsheets when they were compared with the Job Balance record. (6) In any event, an evaluation of the Price Spreadsheets was not necessary to the Tribunal's decision. Once it found that Mr Borg did not exist, the 'elaborate arrangements alleged as to how he ... was paid may be of limited relevance.' For that reason, the Tribunal took the view that the submissions made by the Commissioner concerning the Price Spreadsheets were of 'peripheral relevance'. (7) It is clear that an immaterial error of law will not vitiate the decision of the Tribunal. Even though it was perhaps not necessary to do so once it found that Mr Borg did not exist, the Tribunal for the sake of completeness annexed the Commissioner's analysis of the Price Spreadsheets to its reasons, and held that it correctly summarised the evidence given in this regard. (8) The evidence showed that Mrs Montgomery, having prepared the Price Spreadsheets, was the person who was most familiar with those documents and may be taken to have intimately known the content of them. She must also be taken to have been aware that the figures in those documents had been manipulated in order to reach the totals on the cheques (as the Commissioner has demonstrated in Annexure A to the Tribunal's reasons). (9) It was also an incontrovertible fact that Mrs Montgomery had also managed to create a Price Spreadsheet in respect of items which proved not to be for hire at all but for sale, demonstrating the fact of its fabrication. Mrs Montgomery was cross-examined about this and it was directly put to her in the following terms: 'Really, Ms Montgomery, what this shows is that your documents at tab 14 are a fabrication, aren't they?---No, they're not. They came out of the computer program. You have told us that the starting point of one of them, the first one behind tab 14 for the week ending 28 December, is a real document from the time, haven't you?---That's right. It's nothing of the kind, is it?---Yes, it is. It's something that you have put together to try to substantiate numbers?---No. I took it out of off the job balance generals. And then you have told us that you have extrapolated back, and, lo and behold, you have been able to extrapolate for the week ending 7 December by adding and subtracting advices and receipts to page 427, a number of 16,500, which you purport would explain another entry in the bank statements and on Mr Borg's statements of account?---These were all these all came out of the computer program. These, being tab 14?---These were all worked out of the computer program. They have been massaged the numbers have been massaged and fiddled with---?---No. ---and put together by you---' (10) Clearly Mrs Montgomery, as the author of the recreated Price Spreadsheets, was only too aware of what the cross-examiner was putting to her when he suggested that she had massaged and fiddled the numbers. If there was an answer to be made by her, 3D was on notice of the need to elicit that explanation in re-examination or by seeking leave to adduce further evidence in chief. Application of the Rule in Browne v Dunn (11) Section 33(1)(b) of the AAT Act stipulates that a proceeding before the Tribunal shall be conducted with as little formality and technicality as the legislation and a proper consideration of the matters permits. Consistent with that legislative approach, s 33(1)(c) provides that the Tribunal is not bound by the rules of evidence. (12) 3D, before the Tribunal, had suggested that there was a 'clear breach of the rule in Browne v Dunn '. In Re Ruddock (in his capacity as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs) and Another; Ex parte Applicant S154/2002 [2003] HCA 60 ; (2003) 201 ALR 437 , the High Court held that the rule in Browne v Dunn had no application to proceedings before the Refugee Review Tribunal. Section 420(2) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (an equivalent provision to s 33 of the AAT Act) was relevant to that conclusion. The High Court held that the purpose of such provisions was to free bodies such as the Tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law. (13) In any event, even assuming the rule was to apply, there was no breach of that rule. Where it is obvious that the evidence of the witness is challenged, failure to state this expressly will not necessarily involve a breach of the rule. (14) In Jagelman v Commissioner of Taxation 96 ATC 4055 , it was submitted that there was a denial of procedural fairness by reason of a failure to put a matter to the applicant. Justice Hill observed at 4060: 'However, it has been pointed out in a number of cases that the application of the rule in Browne v Dunn must depend upon the circumstances of the case. Where the issues in a case are such that it would readily be apparent to a party that a particular imputation has been made, there will be no necessity to put that imputation to a witness who denies it and, in consequence, there will have been no denial of procedural fairness: see Seymour v Australian Broadcasting Commission (unreported, Court of Appeal, NSW, 3 June 1977) discussed by Hunt J in Allied Pastoral Holdings Pty Ltd v FCT [1983] 1 NSWLR 1 at 21-2. In the latter case, Hunt J said (at 23): ""In many cases, of course, counsel for the party calling the witness in question will be alert to the relevance of the other material in the case to be relied upon for the challenge to the truth of the evidence given by his witness or to the credit of that witness, and in those circumstances counsel will be able to give his witness the opportunity to deal with that other material in his own evidence in chief.""' It was open to the Tribunal to look at the Price Spreadsheets and draw its own conclusions (15) Section 43 of the AAT Act provides that the Tribunal may exercise all the powers and discretions that are conferred on the decision-maker and stands in the shoes of the Commissioner. The Tribunal is not bound by the facts that were before the decision-maker. (16) The Price Spreadsheets and the Job Balance General were 3D's documents and their inherent want of authenticity could be gathered directly from them. 3D's written submissions in chief to the Tribunal invited consideration of the content of the documents, independent of any testimony about them from which 3D asserted that their authenticity was self-evident. The Commissioner was entitled to (and did) respond on the same basis. It was open to the Tribunal to draw the conclusions which the Commissioner invited, simply by looking at the documents. In particular, that there had been manipulation of those documents by either omitting or falsely inserting information in order to reach a figure corresponding to the cheque which was drawn. Opportunity to Re-open (17) Section 39 of the AAT Act requires that the Tribunal ensure that every party to a proceeding before the Tribunal is given a reasonable opportunity to present his or her case. This section is a statutory recognition of the requirement to afford natural justice. Section 33(1)(c) has been held to permit the introduction of further evidence after the conclusion of the hearing. That requirement may extend to permitting a party to adduce new evidence once judgement has been reserved. It has been held that while normally a court will require exceptional circumstances to permit that course, so stringent a test does not apply in AAT hearings. (18) In Sullivan v Department of Transport (1978) 20 ALR 323 , a party was afforded an opportunity by the Tribunal to call further evidence. Justice Deane said as follows: 'In the context of the express invitation to the appellant, at the conclusion of the evidence, to adduce any further evidence or other material and of the complete absence of any indication by the appellant that he was under any misapprehension or that he desired that the proceedings be adjourned, the failure of the Tribunal either to adjourn the proceedings of its own motion or expressly to inform the appellant of his right to seek an adjournment did not, in my view, constitute a failure to ensure that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity of putting his case or otherwise involve a failure to observe the requirements of natural justice.' (19) After the conclusion of the evidence and during the course of 3D's submissions below, the Tribunal indicated that it would afford 3D an opportunity to reopen its case if Mr Borg could be found. The Tribunal later repeated this invitation a number of times, that 3D should 'go and find Mr Borg', for the reason that he was 'either crucial or important in this equation'. (20) 3D acknowledged that it was open to it to re-open its case. It was open to 3D to have recalled Mrs Montgomery or any other witness it thought could shed light on the figures in the Price Spreadsheets, the authenticity of which the Commissioner had challenged, first in cross-examination of Mrs Montgomery and subsequently in written submissions. It did not do so for the obvious reason that there was no possible explanation for the discrepancies identified by the Commissioner, other than that the figures had been manipulated or fabricated. (21) The Tribunal amply accorded natural justice in the present case by extending an opportunity to 3D to call further evidence and by providing a further opportunity to be heard. Thereafter, any potential lack of procedural fairness arising from the level of detail of the original cross-examination (the Commissioner does not accept that there was any) was averted. 3D did not avail itself of the opportunity. 18 Despite the provisions of subs 33(1) of the AAT Act, I am not persuaded that everything that was said by Gummow and Heydon JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) in Applicant S154/2002 concerning the non-applicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn to proceedings in the Refugee Review Tribunal can be transported, so to speak, to proceedings in the Tribunal. At [55] and [56], their Honours said: '[55] On occasion the submissions advanced for the prosecutrix were couched in the language of a contention that the rule in Browne v Dunn had not been complied with. Where a complaint is made about the failure of a questioner to put to a person giving oral answers a particular question, it is natural for a lawyer's mind to turn to the rule in Browne v Dunn. In essence, and subject to numerous qualifications and exceptions, that rule requires the cross-examiner of a witness in adversarial litigation to put to that witness the nature of the case on which the cross-examiner's client proposes to rely in contradiction of that witness. [56] However, the rule has no application to proceedings in the tribunal. Section 420(2) of the Act states: The Tribunal, in reviewing a decision: (a) is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence; and (b) must act according to substantial justice and the merits of the case. The purpose of a provision such as s 420(2) is to free bodies such as the tribunal from certain constraints otherwise applicable in courts of law which the legislature regards as inappropriate. Further, as was emphasised in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; [(1996) 185 CLR 259 at 282], administrative decision-making is of a different nature from decisions to be made on civil litigation conducted under common law procedures. There, the court has to decide where, on the balance of probabilities, the truth lies as between the evidence the parties to the litigation have considered it in their respective interests to adduce at trial.'"

That means that the application falls for determination having regard to the circumspection in relation to the striking out of a pleading counselled by authorities such as General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125. 6 In the substantive proceeding the case advanced by the BoQ parties may be summarised as follows: (a) each of the OMB parties who entered into an OMB Agreement was an ""independent contractor""; (b) each respective OMB Agreement related to the performance of work by that party as an independent contractor; (c) there exists in each respective case the requisite constitutional connection specified in s 5(2) of the Independent Contractors Act 2006 (Cth); (d) accordingly, each respective OMB Agreement is a ""services contract"" as defined by s 5(1) of the Independent Contractors Act ; (e) s 106 of the NSW Act is a law of a State which expressly provides for a court to make an order or determination in relation to a ""services contract"" on an unfairness ground setting aside, declaring void or amending or varying that contract; (f) the effect of s 7(1)(c) of the Independent Contractors Act and s 109 of the Constitution is that the OMB Agreements are not affected by s 106 of the NSW Act; (g) accordingly, the Industrial Court of New South Wales has no jurisdiction to make an order under s 106 of the NSW Act in respect of the OMB Agreements. 20 Well over a century ago, in Daly v Egan (1886) 12 VLR 81 , at 84, a Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria observed of the jurisdiction to give summary judgment that: This summary jurisdiction is not intended to be exercised where the defendant has any plausible defence, or disputes any of the material facts. A Judge in chambers is not to try a case on affidavit where the facts are in dispute. See also to like effect in that same year observations made by Holroyd J in White v Johnston (1886) 8 ALT 53. Thus, when in General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) (1964) 112 CLR 105 , at 129-130 Barwick CJ cited with approval the following observation of Dixon J (as he then was) in Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 , at 91 that: The fact that a transaction is intricate may not disentitle the court to examine a cause of action alleged to grow out of it for the purpose of seeing whether the proceeding amounts to an abuse of process or is vexatious, But once it appears that there is a real question to be determined whether of fact or law and that the rights of the parties depend upon it, then it is not competent for the court to dismiss the action as frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of process, he was not promoting any novel approach to the disposal of an application like the present. The approach described had been evident since colonial times. Real questions of law and fact are raised by para 52(c) and paras 57 to 63 of the amended defence. It is not appropriate to deal with them summarily. Further, that there are presently hypothetical qualities to the questions of law sought to be agitated by the BoQ parties is an added reason, in the exercise of federal jurisdiction, for this Court not to answer them at this stage. The courts created by the Commonwealth Parliament under Chapter III of the Constitution do not give advisory opinions: In Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts [1921] HCA 20 ; (1921) 29 CLR 257."
Case4126,discussed,Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525,"The Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the proceedings before Buddin J could be described as having resulted in a conviction for a criminal offence. It referred to a number of authorities to which I will have to refer in due course, including Attorney General (NSW) v Whiley (1993) 31 NSWLR 314; Whitham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 and Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Pty Limited [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98. The Tribunal concluded that there was no doubt that proceedings before Buddin J had been brought with the purpose of punishing Mr Seymour noting that it had been common ground, as Buddin J recorded in his reasons, that the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) applied and that the penalty imposed had been one of imprisonment for a fixed term, as opposed to an indefinite term until the contempt of being purged. The tribunal then said: '24. Therefore whilst not free from doubt, I accept for current purposes that the contempt proceedings before Buddin J were criminal. 25. The result of that finding has application to both subparagraphs 5.2 and 5.4 of the Respondent's Statement of Facts and Contentions.' 31 Mr Seymour relied upon the statement that all proceedings for contempt ' must realistically be seen as criminal in nature ' as Deane J pointed out in Hinch v Attorney General (Vict) [1987] HCA 56 ; (1987) 164 CLR 15 at 49 and as approved by Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534. It was said that, accordingly, the tribunal's finding that the contempt charge determined by Buddin J was criminal was an error of law. Next he argued that that error of law affected the tribunal's finding that Mr Seymour demonstrated a lack of candour and openness by his apparently contradictory stances taken before the Court of Appeal in the earlier contempt proceedings (namely that the Law Society should not be allowed to appeal against his acquittal) and his stance in the proceedings before the tribunal (that the proceedings before Buddin J were not criminal). 34 The Authority submitted that the tribunal was correct to classify the proceedings before Buddin J as having involved a conviction of a criminal offence by reference to the character of the jurisdiction invoked under Pt 55 rr 7 and 13 of the Supreme Court Rules , the fact that the proceedings were to seek the punishment by imprisonment of Mr Seymour and the nature of the inherent jurisdiction to punish for contempt. The Authority submitted that the character of the contempt charged before Buddin J was that of disobedience, in the sense of a defiance of the authority of the Supreme Court and that there was a public injury occasioned by such defiance. It was said that, the purpose of the proceedings was to maintain the integrity of the judicial process, to advance the public interest to vindicate judicial authority or to maintain the integrity of the judicial process, relying on that class of contempt as being within a class of criminal contempt as explained in Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR at 531. 73 In Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 all justices considered the historical classification of contempts as 'civil' and 'criminal' to be unsatisfactory. Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ described the differences upon which the distinction of classification is based as being in many respects 'illusory' (183 CLR at 534) while McHugh J said the case for abolishing the distinction 'is a strong one' (183 CLR at 549). 75 The reliance on the distinction in a case like the present, where the applicant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment, suspended, for breaching a court order shows how unworkable the distinction really is in practice. Was the contempt with which the applicant was charged civil when the charge was preferred? Did it remain so or did it transmute, as the seriousness of, and contumaciousness of, his conduct was proved in evidence or found by Buddin J when giving judgment? The very notion that an allegation of contempt can have such a chameleon-like character demonstrated, in Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 108-109 and in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525, that all such cases had to be decided on the criminal standard of proof. The High Court did not have to decide in the latter case whether the distinction between 'civil' and 'criminal' contempt should be abolished (see 183 CLR at 549). 76 In Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534, Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said that because of the illusory nature of the differences said to exist between the 'civil' and 'criminal' classes of contempt and the fact that the usual outcome of all such proceedings is punishment, all proceedings for contempt must realistically be seen as criminal in nature. 77 That does not result in all contempt proceedings themselves being now seen to be for a criminal offence. Indeed, their Honours went on to say (183 CLR at 534): 'However, to say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge. There are clear procedural differences, the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury, whereas charges of contempt do not. There is no basis, in our view, for importing into the law of contempt the nineteenth century rules which allowed a verdict of guilty, given in a jury trial, to be quashed on appeal, but did not permit of an order for retrial. Moreover, the issue, so far as contempt is concerned, is not whether there should be a retrial, but whether there should be a rehearing.' 84 The elusiveness of the distinction Windeyer J identified is demonstrated by the result in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525. There the question was what standard of proof applied, i.e. civil or criminal, in proceedings which fell squarely within Lord Atkinson's 'civil' classification, namely, charges of contempt that the appellant knowingly or recklessly presented a false or misleading statement of his assets and liabilities in an affidavit which he had been ordered to make and that he breached (what was then termed) a Mareva injunction, (this is now known as a Mareva order: Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 393-394 [25] [-26]) by dealing with his assets contrary to the terms. Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said (183 CLR at 533-534): 'Given that purpose or object cannot readily be disentangled from effect and given, also, that a penal or disciplinary jurisdiction may be called into play in proceedings alleging breach of an order or undertaking, it is necessary to acknowledge, as it was in Mudginberri ((1986) [1986] HCA 46 ; 161 CLR 98 at 108), that punitive and remedial objects are, in the words of Salmon LJ ""inextricably intermixed"" ( Jennison v Baker [1972] 2 QB 52 at 64). Moreover and, perhaps, of more importance, nothing is achieved by describing some proceedings as "" punitive "" and others as "" remedial or coercive "". Punishment is punishment, whether it is imposed in vindication or for remedial or coercive purposes. And there can be no doubt that imprisonment and the imposition of fines, the usual sanctions for contempt, constitute punishment. And the same is true of a sequestration made in consequence of a company's failure to comply with an order or undertaking.' 98 When the High Court held in Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 534 that all contempts are criminal in nature and must be proved on the criminal standard, it ensured that the alleged contemnor was afforded the safeguards given at common law to all accuseds. The Court also recognized that the historical classification of 'civil' and 'criminal' contempt is unsatisfactory. 104 Accordingly, I must decide whether Mr Seymour was found by Buddin J to have acted contumaciously in breach of the injunction. A 'civil' contempt can become 'criminal' where the act charged is contumacious in the sense that in doing it there was a direct intention to disobey the order ( Witham v Holloway [1995] HCA 3 ; (1995) 183 CLR 525 at 541 per McHugh J citing Warrington J's well known dictum in Stancomb v Trowbridge Urban Council [1910] 2 Ch 190 at 194). A breach of an injunction or undertaking to the Court can also be criminal if it is '... an obstinate disregard' of the obligation imposed by or owed to the Court ( Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 46 ; (1986) 161 CLR 98 at 111-112). The hallmark of a classification of 'criminal' contempt of this nature is contumacy or defiance ( Australian Consolidated Press Ltd v Morgan [1965] HCA 21 ; (1965) 112 CLR 483 at 489 per Barwick CJ, 501-502 per Windeyer J; Doyle v The Commonwealth [1985] HCA 46 ; (1986) 156 CLR 510 at 516)."

Case3633,cited,J &amp; G Knowles and Associates Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 196 ; (2000) 96 FCR 402 at [22] - [29],"It seems to me at least arguable, on the very limited evidence so far available, that Mr Smith may have discriminated against Ms Campbell in that he treated her less favourably (s 14(2)) because she had an association with (was the mother of) Eleanor who was young and a female. Ms Campbell may be able to argue that if her child was an adult male Mr Smith would not have told her that he would not give her reasons why her son should resign and that he (Mr Smith) would not put anything in writing. This was arguably a matter in connection with the area of training. The Air Training Corps (as its name suggests) was a body whose raison d'&ecirc;tre was training. Ms Campbell herself was not involved in training, but there was a connection between the discrimination alleged and training. What passed between Mr Smith and Ms Campbell concerned the membership of Eleanor, her child, in a body that conducted training of children and young people. There was, arguably a relationship between Mr Smith's conduct vis-&agrave;-vis Ms Campbell and the training activity that was relevant, having regard to the object and purpose of the Anti-Discrimination Act : see O'Grady v Northern Queensland Co Ltd [1990] HCA 16 ; (1990) 169 CLR 356 at 367; J &amp; G Knowles and Associates Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 196 ; (2000) 96 FCR 402 at [22] - [29] ."

Case6278,considered,Minister for Immigration v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77,"The evidence before the Federal Magistrates Court was that on 11 March 1999 the Tribunal sent a letter to the applicant at his address notifying him of the Tribunal's decision to affirm the decision of the delegate which enclosed a copy of the Tribunal's decisions and reasons. The letter informed the applicant that he had 28 days within which to appeal to the Federal Court. It noted that if the letter were posted he would be taken to have received it seven days after the date of the letter. (Presumably this was in reliance upon reg 5.03 of the Migration Regulations which so provided. However, in Minister for Immigration v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77 at 91 [51] O'Connor and Mansfield JJ held that regulation to be invalid to the extent it sought to impose such time constraints.) 23 Regulation 5.03 made provision for deeming a document to be served 7 days after its date. It also permitted the document to be sent on the seventh day so that, in fact, it could not have been received until after the seventh day. A Full Court of this Court held that Regulation 5.03 was ultra vires the regulation making power ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Singh [2000] FCA 377 ; (2000) 98 FCR 77)."
Case2163,discussed,One.Tel Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548,"A court should not engage upon a determination of the merits of the case where the only outstanding claim is as to costs. See Re Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs; Ex parte Lai Qin [1997] HCA 6 ; (1997) 186 CLR 622 and One.Tel Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2000] FCA 270 ; (2000) 101 FCR 548 at 552-553. Those cases also demonstrate that a court may inquire as to the reasonableness of the conduct of the parties to ascertain whether or not orders for costs should be made. Those cases would have no point if it were open to a party to ask the court to make a judgment in the very general form suggested by counsel. That in the present actions against Giant Marine, the Adsteam payments have disposed of all issues other than costs appears from the decision of the High Court in Baxter v Obacelo Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 66 ; (2001) 205 CLR 635 per Gleeson CJ and Callinan J at [38], [39], [40], [43], [46] and [47] and per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [55] and [56]. In particular it should be noted that Gummow and Hayne JJ approved the statement of ""general principle"" contained in the passage cited at [56] from the judgment of Auld LJ in Jameson v Central Electricity Generating Board [1998] QB 323. That general principle is: Where accord and satisfaction cannot be relied upon, as where a claimant settles with only one of two concurrent tortfeasors, the tortfeasor facing a claim will nevertheless have a defence if the plaintiff's settlement with the other has fully compensated him for the separate wrongs done to him. 18 Finally, the plaintiffs seek to distinguish Lai Qin and One.Tel upon the basis that they presently ask for summary judgment or judgment on admissions and not a trial. I see no merit in that argument. In preparing for such an application costs will be incurred by both sides. In some cases those costs may be relatively insignificant. In others they may be substantial. The policy considerations supporting the decisions to which I have referred are as relevant to these applications as they are to trials. 20 The plaintiffs submit that if they are not entitled to summary judgment they are nonetheless entitled, in claiming costs, to seek to demonstrate that they would probably have won had the actions gone to judgment. They rely on the same matters as they rely upon in connection with the summary judgment application plus some aspects of the evidence filed in anticipation of a trial. Their position seems to be that Giant Marine ought to have responded to that evidence, and that its failure to do so demonstrates that their evidence ought to be accepted. There is an incongruity between such an approach and the decisions in Lai Qin and One.Tel to which I have previously referred. If the parties are to call and cross-examine witnesses, then the process starts to look very much like a trial on the merits for the sole purpose of deciding questions of costs. The plaintiffs' approach also ignores the possibility that even in the absence of contrary evidence, their evidence may have been discredited in cross-examination."

Case24364,cited,Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679,"referred to cl 10 at [18] above. Clause 10 was as follows: The Licensor or their agent shall sell the seed or product delivered to it by the grower (or otherwise subject to this agreement) via the payment schedule as per attachment. Clause 10 appears to be a promise by AAC to ICM that AAC or Namoi will sell seed and product delivered to ""it"" by ICM ""via the payment schedule as per attached"". It is common ground that at least the form of the Commercial Crop Contract was attached. There is a sort of payment schedule in cl 4 of the Commercial Crop Contract. That clause listed ""Guaranteed Minimum Prices"" promised to ICM as the grower. It appears that either AAC was, through its agent Namoi, a party to the Commercial Crop Contract as a principal whose existence and identity were not disclosed on the face of that document, or at least the agent Namoi entered into the Commercial Crop Contract in its own right but AAC approved of its doing so as the necessary and contemplated means of implementing the Grower's Licence. Even on the latter basis, it is arguable that AAC was bound by Mr Young's conduct on behalf of Namoi in the discussion on 29 May 2003. The date fixed for completion of the Commercial Crop Contract, 30 June 2003, was not intended to be of the essence of that contract. I mean that ICM was not entitled immediately following 30 June to terminate the contractual relationship for Namoi's failure to pay on that date. This is demonstrated by the second and last sentences of cl 3(c). The whole of cl 3(c) is as follows: Subject to normal seasonal conditions, delivery and payment under this contract is to be completed prior to 30 June 2003. If due to extraneous circumstances by either party that this contract is not completed by this date then mediation with regards to settlement terms must occur. A suggestion is that if the Grower is deemed to be at fault they would not charge the Licensor carry (storage) from this date and the credit limit in place would be renegotiated. If the Licensor is deemed to be at fault then a negotiated percentage of the balance of the products to be paid at this date. The present case concerns an assignment of a bare cause of action for unliquidated damages for breach of contract, not of a property right to which a cause of action is ancillary. The parties accepted that in these circumstances the assignment could be sustained only if Mr Young had a genuine commercial interest in taking the assignment and enforcing it for his own benefit: see Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 703, which has been followed in many cases in Australia including, but not limited to, Re Timothy's Pty Ltd and the Companies Act [1981] 2 NSWLR 706; Commonwealth v Ling (1993) 44 FCR 397 ; National Mutual Property Services (Australia) Pty Ltd v Citibank Savings Ltd (1995) 132 ALR 514 ; and see G Tolhurst, The Assignment of Contractual Rights (Hart Publishing, 2006) at [6.59]ff . The circumstances of the present case are analogous to those in Monk in which the assignee's interest was that of obtaining a set-off against a judgment debt. In that case, Cohen J said (at 153): The plaintiff's only apparent interest is in the possibility of his becoming a creditor of the Bank. That is, his interest is in using the debt which might arise from the cause of action for his personal benefit. That no doubt is the interest of any assignee. The using of the debt as a set-off against the judgment debt is merely an example of obtaining some personal benefit. In that regard the plaintiff is in no stronger position than he would be if he had obtained an assignment of a cause of action for negligence by a customer of the Bank who claimed to have suffered injuries arising from unsafe premises. In the authorities where the Trendtex test has been applied, the commercial interest has gone beyond a mere personal interest in profiting from the outcome of the proceedings and has required an interest by the assignee in the assignor or its business affairs or activities which the assignment may in some way protect. These observations are applicable, mutatis mutandis , to the present case."
Case20246,followed,Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543,"The appellant requires leave to amend his pleadings pursuant to Order 52 Rule 21(3) of the Federal Court Rules . The principles relating to a grant of such leave were considered by the Full Court of this Court in Gomez v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2002) 190 ALR 543 where the Court observed that ' exceptional circumstances' might exist to justify such grant. The Court said at [18]: 'The reference to ""exceptional circumstances"" indicates that there remains a discretion in the court to entertain a new ground of appeal if it is expedient and in the interests of justice to do so...' 15 The function of this Court in an appeal is to review alleged errors of the Federal Magistrate and not alleged errors of the Tribunal see: Sathiyanathan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 210 at [10] . However, since the decision in NBKT which was handed down after Emmett FM gave her decision directly impacts upon the issues to be considered in this appeal, ' exceptional circumstances ' as referred to in Gomez exist. Accordingly the Court considers that the interests of justice require that the appellant be permitted to rely upon the Amended Notice of Appeal and the Court will consider the appellant's claims as they relate to the Tribunal proceedings."

Case15869,discussed,Crosbie v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 922 ; (2003) 130 FCR 275,"The authorities recognise that directors in the position of Scott and Fairbank should be able to contest the liquidator's claims against the Commissioner: see Crosbie v Commissioner of Taxation [2003] FCA 922 ; (2003) 130 FCR 275 at [4] - [7] (' Crosbie' ); Hall v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] NSWSC 985 ; (2004) 186 FLR 111 at [16] and [21]-[23] (' Hall' ), and Dean-Willcocks v Commissioner of Taxation (No 2) (2004) 49 ACSR 325. In Crosbie , Finkelstein J made an order that the directors have leave to defend the liquidator's claim against the Commissioner of Taxation on terms that they be bound by all decisions made in that action and they be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs. In Hall , Barrett J directed that the third parties have leave to appear and take part in the hearing of the plaintiffs' claims and to defend those claims: at [25]. 24 When these issues were raised, I made orders in each proceeding in the same form as those made by Finkelstein J in Crosbie . Specifically, I ordered that the third parties have leave to defend the plaintiff's claim against the Commissioner on terms that: (a) they each be bound by all decisions made in those actions; and (b) they each be treated as if parties to the action on any issue relating to costs. This order was not opposed by either the plaintiff or the Commissioner. 25 In Crosbie , Finkelstein J also expressed the view, which was not necessary to his decision, that the Court should not act on the parties' admissions as to insolvency without satisfying itself on the evidence as to the correctness of that admission. In his Honour's view, this conclusion followed from the fact that the Court can only make an order under s 588FF if it is satisfied that a transaction of a company is voidable under s 588FE. Subsequent cases have rejected this view, and held that the Court can reach the requisite satisfaction on the basis of the parties' agreement: see Wanted World Wide (Australia) Limited v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCA 1063 ; (2004) 139 FCR 205 (' Wanted World Wide ') and Young v Commissioner of Taxation (2006) 56 ACSR 654 (' Young' ). As I see it, no practical significance attaches to the issue in this case, notwithstanding the settlement reached between the plaintiff and the Commissioner, because the claims made by the plaintiff as to solvency and other matters were contested by Scott and Fairbank. However, if and to the extent that the issue has any significance for this case, I prefer, and would apply, the views expressed in Wanted World Wide and Young ."
Case288,considered,Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463,"The above considerations are to be construed in light of the fundamental right of a citizen to have access to the courts: see The Airtourer Co-operative Ltd v Millicer Aircraft Industries Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1400 at [18] (' Airtourer '). As Morling J observed in Barton v Minister for Foreign Affairs (1984) 2 FCR 463 at 469: 'It has never been the case that impecuniosity on the part of a plaintiff is a ground for ordering him to give security for costs. In Pearson v. Naydler [1977] 1 W.L.R. 899, Megarry V-C said: ""The basic rule that a natural person who sues will not be ordered to give security for costs, however poor he is, is ancient and well-established. As Bowen L.J. said in Cowell v Taylor (1885) 31 Ch. D. 34 at 38, both at law and in equity 'the general rule is that poverty is no bar to a litigant'. The power to require security for costs ought not to be used so as to bar even the poorest man from the courts.""' However, as Branson J noted in Airtourer at [21]: 'Recognition by this Court of the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant has not meant that the Court has proceeded on the basis that an order for security for costs can never be made against a litigant. An order for security for costs is only rarely sought against a litigant who is not impecunious. An order for security for costs made against an impecunious litigant when justified by a factor other than mere impecuniosity does not offend the general rule that poverty is no bar to a litigant.'"
Case22333,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 706,"Engaging in resale price maintenance is engaging in anti-competitive conduct, which the legislature has prohibited in the public interest. As Merkel J said in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Humax Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 706 ("" Humax "") at [5], engaging in resale price maintenance is a serious offence. This is apparent from the magnitude of the pecuniary penalties that corporations, and those through whom they act, may face for contravention of s 48 of the Act . 11 The consent orders proposed by the parties include: (a) declarations under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) that the particular conduct in which each of the respondents engaged constituted a contravention of the Act ; (b) injunctions restraining each of the respondents from engaging in proscribed conduct for a period of three years from the date of the order; (c) orders requiring TEAC to establish an education and compliance programme for its employees; (d) an order that TEAC pay a pecuniary penalty of $175,000 in four instalments; and (e) an order that Mr Allison pay a pecuniary penalty of $15,000 in four instalments. There is to be a further order, providing for what is to happen in the event of default in the payment of any instalment of penalty. 14 The proposed probation order in this case is very like the probation orders made by Merkel J in Humax and by Tracey J in Digital Products. Section 86D contemplates orders of the kind proposed as adverse publicity orders: see orders 8 and 9 in the proposed minute of orders. 28 I also accept that the proposed penalties are consistent with the proper application of the totality and parity principles: compare Digital Products and Dataline at [64]-[75]. I was referred to a schedule of previous determinations. Whilst I have had regard to it, I have also borne in mind the observations in Dataline , where a Full Court said (at [67]-[68]): [T] he Court is confirmed in the view that there is little to be gained in undertaking ... a detailed comparative analysis of the conduct of each corporation in the identified cases, the extent to which particular officers of those corporations engaged in the contravening conduct or the scale and dimension of the conduct. The constellation of circumstances, essential character of the conduct and the factors to be weighed by the Court are inevitably sufficiently different in each case that previous determinations ultimately provide little utility in precisely informing the appropriate pecuniary penalty to be imposed in any particular contravention. However, an assessment of previous determinations in relation to resale price maintenance conduct may provide a high level broad range within which an appropriate pecuniary penalty may be imposed having regard to the character and content of the contravention and other considerations reflecting some elements broadly consistent with the evidence in the particular case. After making these observations, the Court undertook an analysis of several cases with sufficiently similar facts to provide a high level broad range of comparison. The penalties imposed in a number of cases ( Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dermalogica Pty Ltd [2005] 215 ALR 482 ("" Dermalogica ""), Humax , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Tooltechnic Systems (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 432 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Westminster Retail Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2005] FCA 1299 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v High Adventure Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 247 , Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cambur Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1027 , Dataline (upholding the decision in Australian Consumer and Competition Commission v Dataline.Net.Au Pty Ltd (2006) 236 ALR 665), Jurlique , and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Chaste Corporation Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2005] FCA 1212) give a high level broad range of comparison for this case. 30 I accept that, in the circumstances mentioned above and on the financial material before the Court, it is appropriate to order the payment of penalties by instalments. The parties have agreed to the inclusion in orders of a default provision. The Court made similar orders in Digital Products and Humax ."
Case18136,followed,SZHPI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 306,"It is not the fact that the Tribunal has not referred to such evidence as that set forth (for example) in the Walter Turnbull report which exposes a "" question of law "" ( SZEHN v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1389 at [58] per Lindgren J; SZHPI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 306 at [15] ). The question arises by reason of the Tribunal not making necessary findings of fact and referring to the evidence upon which it makes such findings.

It is for the Court to assess the totality of the evidence to determine whether the Land Council has established, on the balance of probabilities, that native title does not exist. Worimi has identified a number of different groups, at various stages of these proceedings, that he says hold native title in the Land, including himself and his immediate family, and all Worimi people. He must also provide evidence that addresses, at the least, the Land Council's evidence that there is no native title within the principles set down in Yorta Yorta ; that there is no normative body of laws and customs in connection with the Land, the observance of which has been substantially maintained from the time of sovereignty to the present day. Worimi does not need to prove each element of native title. He is not obliged to establish native title as if it were a positive defence being asserted. He does, however, need to address native title under the Act by reference to those material matters. He must address the necessary elements sufficiently to cast doubt on the Land Council's assertion of no native title. He needs to show that there have existed traditional laws and customs in relation to the Land, the continued observance of those laws and customs and the maintenance of a connection with the Land. If he does not lead evidence as to each of those matters, elements of native title, he will need to adduce evidence, sufficient in scope and weight, as to one or more of those elements to cast doubt on the proposition that native title does not exist. 56 Worimi contends that the evidence required to discharge the Land Council's onus of proof ' may not be achieved without strict proof of historical and anthropological facts through use of widely accepted authoritative writings and expert evidence ' and ' involves consideration of the historical, archaeological, linguistic and anthropological evidence in the light of the direct testimony of Aboriginal witnesses '. Worimi says that, in determining the question of the existence or non-existence of native title on the balance of probabilities, regard should be had to the ability of the parties to adduce evidence. By this, he seems to be saying that the Court should give more weight to his evidence and discount the evidence of the Land Council. If he is, I do not accept it. 64 Based on the presumption that native title exists over the Land, Worimi contends that: &#8226; It is common ground that Lot 576 falls within traditional Worimi country. &#8226; The Land Council must prove that any connection which Aboriginal people may have had with the Land under traditional laws and customs has not been maintained. &#8226; In order to succeed, the Land Council must establish that traditional law and custom has ceased to be observed anywhere in ""Worimi country"". &#8226; It is incumbent upon the Land Council to adduce evidence from Worimi people positively to assert that no laws and customs have been passed down to them by their forebears and, additionally, there needs to be expert evidence that there were a set of normative rules traditionally adopted and followed and observed by the Worimi people. &#8226; Following Yorta Yorta , the Land Council must prove that pre-existing laws and customs have been substantially interrupted from what they were at sovereignty or no longer exist at all. &#8226; There must be evidence of the cessation of the acknowledgement of laws and observance of customs sufficient to show that those laws and customs have been abandoned by the whole of Worimi society. 65 Worimi submits that the evidence supports the inference that there was a group of Worimi people and a society of Aboriginal people who inhabited the area around Port Stephens at the time of sovereignty. For the purposes of this application, I accept that to be the case. 66 Worimi submits that, once this is accepted, it follows that this group had some form of normative rules which regulated their society and that, once this is accepted, it follows ' as a matter of logic and reason ' that, bearing in mind the burden of proof, the Land Council is required to lead sufficient evidence: (i) of the nature and existence of pre-sovereign native title rights and interests; and (ii) to the effect that these pre-sovereign rights and interests are no longer observed before the Court may infer the non-existence of native title over Lot 576. 72 In Mason v Tritton (1994) 34 NSWLR 572, Kirby P pointed to the difficulty for Aboriginal people to provide recorded details of, for example, genealogy. At 586 589, his Honour discussed the inferences that can be drawn to overcome the absence of evidence for the period from 1788 to a later time, in that case to the 1880s. Referring to the analysis in Wigmore on Evidence, vol 2, 3 rd edition at 437, his Honour said that it is not appropriate to apply a ""presumption of continuance"" but a process of inference. His Honour was prepared to draw an inference from proved use of land in the 1880s back to the time before 1788. As he noted, it is more easily drawn in more traditional Aboriginal communities. However, in Mason , there were other aspects of the claim to native title which were not proved. Further, it is hard to see from Yorta Yorta how a presumption of native title can be said to apply. 134 The Land Council seeks a determination of the absence of native title. That means native title under the Act. In Yorta Yorta , the High Court emphasised that native title under the Act must be understood in accordance with the definition in s 223(1) of the Act. That section provides: (1) The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where: (a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia. 135 In Yorta Yorta at [31], Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ raised the importance of identifying whether the body of traditional law and custom that intersects with the common law for the purposes of s 223(1) of the Act is that as existing at the time of sovereignty or that existing today but connected with a body of law and custom that existed at sovereignty. Their Honours reiterated what had been said in Fejo v Northern Territory [1998] HCA 58 ; (1998) 195 CLR 96. Native title, with its origin in the traditional laws acknowledged and the traditional customs observed by the indigenous people who possess the native title is recognised by the common law. Their Honours went on to state that: ' An application for determination of native title requires the location of that intersection [between native title and the common law] and it requires that it be located by reference to [the Act]. In particular it must be located by reference to the definition of native title in s 223(1) '. A determination of the existence of native title is a creature of the Act ( Yorta Yorta at [32]). So too is a determination of the absence of native title. 136 A number of principles relevant to the present case were set out in Yorta Yorta: &#8226; Laws or customs in which native title rights or interests find their origins must be laws or customs having a normative content and deriving, therefore, from a body of norms or normative system that existed before sovereignty (at [38]). &#8226; Observable patterns of behaviour may not amount to rights or interests in relation to land or waters under the Act (at [42]). &#8226; Upon the Crown acquiring sovereignty, the normative or law-making system which then existed could not thereafter validly create new rights, duties or interests. Rights or interests in land created after sovereignty and which owed their origin and continued existence only to a normative system other than that of the new sovereign power are not given effect (at [43] and [44]). &#8226; This does not prevent the transmission of rights and interests under traditional laws and traditional customs which existed at sovereignty. Nor does it prevent any alteration to, or development of, that traditional law and custom after sovereignty. Account may at least be taken of developments of a kind contemplated by that traditional law and custom (at [44]). &#8226; ""Traditional"" law or custom is apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom. In the context of the Act, the term ""traditional"" conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions. However, in the context of the Act, ""traditional"" laws and customs equate to the normative rules that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown (at [46]). It follows that the mere use of the word ""traditional"" does not establish the normative rules necessary for the establishment of native title under the Act. &#8226; The normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed, namely the traditional laws acknowledged and customs observed, must have had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty. If that normative system has not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. Importantly, any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which right and interest must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title (at [47]). &#8226; If the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs, the laws and customs cease to have continued existence and vitality (at [50]). 137 The Land Council relies not only upon the absence of any claimant application over the Land but also on the evidence from Aboriginal people associated with the area who have confirmed that, in their view, the native title rights and interests that Worimi asserts do not exist. The Land Council has established that no Aboriginal person other than Worimi (and some of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications) asserts that native title exists in relation to Lot 576. All of the Aboriginal witnesses called by the Land Council identified as Worimi people. All are aware of the assertions made by Worimi concerning the existence of native title in the Land and gave evidence generally rejecting those assertions. Some of those witnesses were parties to claimant applications for a determination of the existence of native title in respect of land in the Port Stephens area but none of the witnesses have filed native title claimant applications in relation to the Land or land in the immediate vicinity of Lot 576. 153 Worimi says that his family and his mother before him were removed by actions of others and that the removal was not voluntary. In an area where non-Aboriginal communities developed, many Aboriginal families lived at Karuah, which is also part of Worimi land. In deciding whether claimants, by traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed, have a present connection with land, some interruptions to enjoyment of native title rights and interests is allowed ( Gale at [108], citing Yorta Yorta and De Rose ). 163 As in Yorta Yorta , if there had been a women's site on or near the Land and Kingsley Beach, much has changed since it was used. 164 This baptism of Worimi's grandson by his daughter Beryl and wife Cynthia represents an attempt by Worimi to restore what he says his grandmother told him, as amended by his wife's practices. It does not represent continuity. Worimi has claimed that the site is sacred to all Worimi women. No woman has supported this claim, apart from some members of his immediate family who supported his claimant applications. 165 In Gale, Madgwick J was dealing with a native title claimant application from which the claimants withdrew. One of the respondents, Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council, sought an order that there was no native title over the subject land. Expert evidence had been filed in support of the claimant applications to which the Deerubbin Local Aboriginal Land Council had responded. His Honour considered Yorta Yorta and drew from it a number of relevant principles, including: &#8226; [N] ative title rights and interests derive from traditional laws and customs in the sense that they survived the acquisition of sovereignty over Australia: Yorta Yorta at [75]. &#8226; The rights and interests must be presently 'possessed' under traditional laws and customs. This requires that the normative system under which those rights or interests are possessed ... be a system that has had a 'continuous existence and vitality' since sovereignty: Yorta Yorta at [47]. &#8226; Some change to or adaptation of traditional law or custom or some interruption of enjoyment or exercise of native title rights or interests since sovereignty will not necessarily be fatal to a native title claim. &#8226; The statutory questions (in s 223) are directed to the present possession of the rights or interests, not their exercise, and to the existence of a relevant, present connection. It follows that the non-exercise of native title rights or interests by some of the persons now claiming such rights or interests ... will not inevitably be fatal. &#8226; The requirement in s 223(1)(b) for connection with land or waters by traditional laws and customs must be a connection which the peoples concerned have by their traditional laws and customs, that is the laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the ancestors of the claimants at the time of sovereignty. It is the normative quality of the normative rules which rendered the Crown's radical title acquired at sovereignty subject to the rights and interests then existing and which are now identified as native title. &#8226; It is an important qualification that the acknowledgment and observance of those rules need only have continued substantially, and not entirely, uninterrupted. &#8226; Nonetheless, it is necessary to demonstrate that it is the normative system of the pre-sovereign society out of which the claimed rights and interests arise. This entails that it be shown that that society has continued to exist as a body united by its acknowledgement and observance of the traditional laws and customs. &#8226; Acknowledgement and observance of those laws and customs must have continued substantially uninterrupted since sovereignty. It is not enough that there be a body of laws and customs originating in the common acceptance by or agreement of a new society of indigenous peoples to acknowledge and observe them, notwithstanding that they are similar to or even identical with those of an earlier and different society. 167 The positive assertion of native title rights and interests requires more than vague assertions of membership of a group of people and of ""custodianship"" of land. Worimi's facts and contentions comprehensively fail to establish the elements of native title required by s 223 of the Act. They do not establish native title within the meaning of Yorta Yorta . They do not identify the alleged content of the normative body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed by the pre-sovereignty society nor how those laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted. While Worimi is not required positively to establish native title in order to resist the Land Council's application, he must present evidence which is sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements that the evidence does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist. 169 As the High Court said in Yorta Yorta , the relevant laws and customs must be rules having normative content. Without that quality, there may be observable patterns of behaviour but not rights or interests in relation to land or waters. Rights or interests created after sovereignty are insufficient, although there may be changes in the traditional laws and customs, at least to the extent that such changes and developments were contemplated by traditional laws and customs. 170 As was said in Yorta Yorta at [47] and repeated in Bodney at [47], if the normative system has not existed throughout the period since sovereignty, the rights and interests which owe their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. The law and custom arise out of and go to define a particular society, a body of persons united in and by its acknowledgment and observance of a body of law and customs ( Yorta Yorta at [49]; Bodney at [46]). ' Unless a society has, and acknowledges and observes, laws and customs under which native title rights and interests are possessed, there can be no native title rights whether communal, group or individual ' ( Bodney at [157]). It is therefore necessary for a person claiming native title to show that the normative system that existed at sovereignty is substantially the same as the one that exists today ( Bodney at [47]). This must be established for each generation to establish that the laws and customs have continued to be acknowledged and observed substantially uninterrupted ( Bodney at [70] [74]). 184 It follows from Yorta Yorta at [51] [56] that native title, if it existed pre-sovereignty, ceases to exist for the purposes of the Act if the society, being the Worimi people, the Maiaangal clan or the Garuahgal clan, ceased to acknowledge and observe the laws and customs that Worimi describes. The rights and interests to which those laws and customs give rise are not possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed. They ceased to exist and the later adoption of the laws and customs does not give rise to rights and interests rooted in pre-sovereignty traditional law and custom. 185 The changes in Worimi's description of the persons who, he says, observe or observed the traditional laws and customs in respect of the Land have not assisted in the analysis of the evidence. As set out in Worimi 2007 and Worimi 2006 , he has changed the identification of the persons said to be relevant. As to the identification of family members in the claim group, Worimi has included, variously apart from himself, his wife and children, all his sisters and their daughters and his mother. He was not consistent in his evidence, asserting that he was bringing the claim on behalf of the Garuahgal women, his family and all Worimi people. Irrespective of the group said to hold native title over the Land, the requirements of s 223 of the Act are not satisfied. While Worimi was not required to establish native title in accordance with s 223 of the Act in order to resist the Land Council's application, given the time available to Worimi since these proceedings were commenced, he has had ample opportunity to formulate his contentions with reference to s 223 of the Act in order to cast sufficient doubt on the Land Council's case. 186 The evidence is that the observance of the traditional laws and customs ceased so far as a women's site on the Land is concerned. The evidence is not of adaptation of traditional laws and customs but of substantial interruption, amounting to cessation, of observance."
Case5861,considered,Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (2000) 179 ALR 593,"Instead, the payment secured the use of the Premises for the purposes of generating income from the casino.

Case14685,applied,Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1,"kind of waiver that is in issue in this case is commonly referred to as imputed or implied waiver. The former expression is preferable, as it reflects the way in which the High Court expressed the governing legal principles in Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 ( 'Mann' ). In Mann at 13 [29], Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said: 'Waiver may be express or implied. Disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. When an affirmative answer is given to such a question, it is sometimes said that waiver is ""imputed by operation of law"". This means that the law recognises the inconsistency and determines its consequences, even though such consequences may not reflect the subjective intention of the party who has lost the privilege. Thus, in Benecke v National Australia Bank , the client was held to have waived privilege by giving evidence, in legal proceedings, concerning her instructions to a barrister in related proceedings, even though she apparently believed she could prevent the barrister from giving the barrister's version of those instructions. She did not subjectively intend to abandon the privilege. She may not even have turned her mind to the question. However, her intentional act was inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality of the communication. What brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality; not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.' The concluding part of this passage draws attention to the fact that the test for imputed waiver had previously been expressed in terms of fairness: see Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 (' Maurice' ) at 481 per Gibbs CJ, 487 488 per Mason and Brennan JJ, 492 493 per Deane J, and 497 498 per Dawson J. Under the test propounded in Mann , it is inconsistency between the conduct of the client and the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect which effects a waiver of the privilege. Fairness has become a subsidiary consideration; it may be relevant to the court's assessment of inconsistency in some contexts but not in others. In Commissioner of Taxation v Rio Tinto Limited [2006] FCAFC 86 (' Rio Tinto' ) at [44], the Full Court (Kenny, Stone and Edmonds JJ) said that there was a good deal of doubt whether the language used by the majority in Mann worked any real change in the principle which governs imputed waiver. This observation was made somewhat tentatively and was not material to the Court's decision. My own view is that a test expressed in terms of inconsistency more readily accommodates the variety of situations in which questions of imputed waiver can arise than a test expressed in terms of fairness. The criterion of fairness is readily understandable in the context of inter partes litigation, but it is difficult to apply sensibly in other contexts: see the observations by McHugh J in Mann at 40 [128] and Toohey J in Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 (' Goldberg v Ng' ) at 110. AWB submitted that this Court should hold that there has been no imputed waiver because the Commonwealth has made no attempt to identify why it would be unfair or inequitable for AWB to maintain privilege in the underlying investigations. This submission immediately raises the question unfair or inequitable to whom? I doubt that any question arises of fairness to the Commission it is an arm of the executive government charged with the investigation of specified matters. Nor does any question arise of fairness to the Commonwealth. Fairness presupposes a balancing of interests between parties who are in dispute. In that context, partial disclosures raise a question of fairness because there is the capacity to mislead one party to the dispute to his or her detriment. These concepts do not translate easily to the present case: cf McHugh J in Mann at 40 [127]-[128]. There is also the difficulty that, outside the framework of an inter partes dispute, fairness is truly a term of 'indeterminate reference': Mann at 40 [129] per McHugh J, citing RJ Desiatnik, Legal Professional Privilege in Australia , 1999, p 122. 133 Mann anticipated that there will be cases in which considerations of fairness have little or no role to play. This is such a case. The broad question posed by Mann is whether, and to what extent, AWB's disclosures are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the documents which are at issue in these proceedings. This question wraps up several subsidiary issues, in particular whether AWB's disclosures involved, on each occasion, a disclosure of the gist or substance of its legal advice, whether AWB consciously deployed that advice so as to advance its own commercial or other interests, and, if so, whether that disclosure has resulted in an imputed waiver of privilege over any and what associated materials. In any application of Mann , the starting point must be an analysis of the disclosures or other acts or omissions of the party claiming privilege that are said to be inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the privileged material: see Rio Tinto at [45]. The disclosures in question here were made variously to the IIC, to the Australian Government, to the Commission and in some instances via the procedures of the Commission to the public at large. In my opinion, there is no reason why these disclosures cannot support a finding that AWB has waived legal professional privilege over associated material. AWB submitted that imputed waiver cannot arise in the context of a commission established under the RCA. Alternatively, it submitted that the coercive and inquisitorial context in which the alleged waiver has taken place is an important factor which strongly militates against waiver. These submissions ignore the voluntary disclosures that AWB made to the Australian Government. In any event, I am not persuaded that AWB's disclosures to the Commission and the IIC are incapable of giving rise to an imputed waiver. Leaving aside any question of waiver, AWB was entitled to maintain legal professional privilege in the course of proceedings before the Commission and, by and large, it sought to do so. To the extent that AWB has already produced documents to the Commission containing legal advice or instructions, it did so because it recognised that actions it had taken outside the Commission had the consequence of waiving privilege over those documents. As for the oral evidence that the Commonwealth now relies upon, Lindberg, Cooper and Scales were senior executives of AWB when they gave that evidence to the Commission. There is nothing before me to suggest that they were not speaking as executives of AWB when they gave their evidence, or that their evidence fell outside the scope of their authority from AWB. Further, their evidence was given in the presence of AWB's legal representatives, without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. Lindberg, Cooper and Scales may have been compelled to give evidence at the Commission, but they were under no compulsion to reveal the gist or substance of legal advice that had been obtained by AWB. In these circumstances, I infer that the relevant evidence given by Lindberg, Cooper and Scales was given with the authority or acquiescence of AWB. I also infer that AWB was content for the evidence to be given at public hearings of the Commission, having regard to its own commercial interests. The evidence before me makes it clear that AWB was concerned to defend its integrity and commercial reputation in the course of the Commission's hearings. I infer that AWB made the assessment that it would advance its commercial interests if it were to be known publicly that it had undertaken extensive legal reviews and that, as a result, it had obtained legal advice that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any improper or unlawful conduct in breach of the United Nations' sanctions. AWB was content for information of this character to be disclosed publicly in relation to both Project Rose and Project Water. It would, of course, be a different case if the documents and information that the Commonwealth relies upon were disclosed under legal compulsion. On any view, the fact that documents and information were disclosed under compulsion would be very relevant to the question whether the person claiming privilege had engaged in inconsistent conduct. There is, moreover, authority to the effect that a production of documents or evidence under compulsion will not result in any waiver of privilege: Goldman v Hesper [1988] 1 WLR 1238 ( 'Goldman' ); Trans America Computer Co Inc v IBM Corporation 573 F2d 646 (9 th Cir 1978) ( 'Trans America' ) at 651. AWB's disclosures to the IIC were not made under legal compulsion. They were made by choice under a confidentiality regime negotiated by AWB. The Memorandum of Understanding between AWB and the IIC provided that AWB could withhold documents from the IIC on grounds of commercial sensitivity or legal professional privilege, or if there was a risk that AWB, its officers or employees would be exposed to breaches of Australian law. It also provided that any interviews conducted by the IIC of AWB officers or employees could be undertaken in the presence of a personal legal counsel and/or up to two representatives of AWB. AWB thereby retained the right to object to any question that intruded into areas protected by legal professional privilege. On the evidence before me, including in particular the various briefings which Hargreaves gave to the Australian Government, it is clear that AWB decided that it needed to cooperate, and be seen to cooperate, with the IIC so as to retain the support of the Australian Government and to protect and defend its commercial reputation. I do not agree with AWB's submission that, even if its disclosures were not compelled by law, the inquisitorial context in which they took place is a factor which strongly militates against waiver. In Australia, legal professional privilege is a fundamental common law right that can be asserted outside the context of adversarial litigation. It can, for instance, be invoked to resist the production of documents in answer to a search warrant or the giving of information or the production of documents pursuant to coercive statutory powers or notices: Daniels at 552-553 [9] [11] and 563 [44]; Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52. As legal professional privilege can be invoked outside the context of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings, logic suggests that it should be capable of being waived if the claimant engages in conduct that is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality that the privilege is intended to protect. It should not matter whether the conduct takes place within, or outside, the framework of the proceedings or investigatory process in which a demand has been made for the production of privileged documents or information. The crucial question is whether the conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. The disclosure of privileged communications to a third party can result in an imputed waiver of privilege, even if there is no intention of waiving privilege and the disclosure is for a limited and specific purpose. In Mann , the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory conveyed legal advice, on a confidential basis, to a member of the Territory's Legislative Assembly to enable him to consider the reasonableness of the Government's decision to settle certain legal proceedings. The majority decision turned on the fact that the disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly was not regarded as disclosure to a third party. In their joint judgment, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said at 15 [35] that: 'The purpose of the privilege being to protect the Territory from subsequent disclosure of the legal advice it received concerning the litigation instituted by the appellant, there was nothing inconsistent with that purpose in the Chief Minister conveying the terms of that advice, on a confidential basis, to a member of the Legislative Assembly who wished to consider the reasonableness of the conduct of the Territory in relation to the litigation.' However, their Honours also observed that, while the voluntary disclosure of privileged legal advice to a third party will not necessarily waive privilege, it can do so. They said that Goldberg v Ng illustrates that, depending on the circumstances, the disclosure of a privileged communication to a third party for a limited and specific purpose, and on terms as to confidentiality, can have the consequence of waiving privilege. McHugh J dissented. In his view, any disclosure of privileged material to a third party who is a stranger to the privileged relationship (ie to a person who is not the lawyer or the client) should have the consequence that privilege in that material is waived as against the world: at 34 [108], 37-38 [118], 42 [133]-[134]. As I read his Honour's judgment, the key reason why his Honour preferred a bright line rule of this kind is that it would ensure that legal professional privilege was not extended beyond the rationales that support it (at 37 [117]-[118]): 'Ensuring candid communications between a lawyer and a client is unlikely to be endangered if a privilege holder is held to waive privilege because he or she has voluntarily disclosed the communication to a stranger. Whether the communication will be disclosed in the future to a stranger to the privilege is entirely within the control of the client. At that stage, the client will determine whether his or her interests are best served by retaining the privilege or disclosing the communication. But it is difficult to see how the possibility of voluntary disclosure will prevent the client being candid with his or her lawyer. ... A client who voluntarily discloses privileged information to a stranger to the privileged relationship has made a choice, based no doubt on considerations personal to him or her, that the purpose for which the communication is disclosed to the stranger is more important than protecting the absolute confidentiality of the communication by preventing the stranger from having knowledge of it. The person may be encouraged to do so, as in Goldberg v Ng , by an expectation that the stranger will not further disclose the communication. But in my opinion, if privileged material is voluntarily disclosed to a stranger to the privileged relationship, the fact that it may be received under an obligation of confidence should not be relevant to whether privileged is waived.' On the facts, McHugh J considered that disclosure to a member of the Legislative Assembly who was not a member of the Executive Government was relevantly a disclosure to a stranger to the privileged relationship: at 44 [139]. In Goldberg v Ng , the respondents sued their solicitor, Goldberg, for failure to account for monies received and disbursed by him as their solicitor. They also made a professional conduct complaint against him to the Law Society of New South Wales. In answer to the complaint, Goldberg prepared statements, with annexures that included a draft brief to counsel, and submitted them to the Society's professional conduct department. In doing so, Goldberg told the Society that the statements and the annexures were confidential and he wished to retain his legal professional privilege in them. The Society dismissed the complaint on the ground that there was no evidence of professional misconduct or unsatisfactory professional conduct. Subsequently, in the course of the Supreme Court proceedings instituted by the respondents against Goldberg, the respondents served a subpoena on the Society requiring it to produce documents relating to the complaint against Goldberg. All of the members of the High Court held that there had been no express or intentional waiver by Goldberg of his legal professional privilege in the statements and annexures. The issue that divided the Court was whether waiver should be imputed by operation of law. Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ held at 100-102 that it should because the professional complaint and the Supreme Court proceedings were but different emanations of the one dispute, and Goldberg's provision of the statements to the Society was voluntary and for the calculated purpose of demonstrating the reliability of his denial of the alleged failure to account. Their Honours analysed the issue in terms of 'fairness', but they could equally, and perhaps more appropriately, have done so in terms of inconsistency. Toohey and Gummow JJ dissented in separate judgments. Each expressed the view that waiver should not be imputed because the disclosures by Goldberg were made to a third party for a limited and specific purpose. Toohey J said at 110 that the following factors militated strongly against any implied or imputed waiver: first, Goldberg disclosed material to the Society because of a complaint against him on an undertaking by the Society that the contents would be kept confidential; secondly, the disclosure was made in the context of the Society's investigation of a complaint in pursuance of its statutory powers and, consequently, it could be regarded as having been made for the purposes of the Act; and thirdly, the disclosure was confined to the Society. Gummow J said at 123 that, as the disclosures were made in the context of compulsory statutory processes, the circumstances of the case supplied no sufficient reason for depriving Goldberg of privilege, even allowing for the advantage he sought to gain by making the disclosure. The case of Restom v Battenberg [2006] FCA 781 provides an example of a case where disclosures to a third party triggered a waiver of legal professional privilege. In the course of bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor claimed privilege over a letter that passed between his Australian and Scottish solicitors. Stone J held that the disclosure of the contents of the letter to the Scottish Employment Tribunal was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the letter and constituted a waiver of privilege. In Network Ten Ltd v Capital Television Holdings Ltd (1995) 36 NSWLR 275, which predated Goldberg v Ng and Mann , Giles J held that a limited and specific disclosure of privileged material, on terms of confidentiality, did not result in a loss of privilege. In Australian Rugby Union Ltd v Hospitality Group Pty Ltd (1999) 165 ALR 253, Sackville J said that it follows from Goldberg v Ng that the disclosure of a privileged communication for a limited purpose and subject to a confidentiality requirement may, or may not, amount to a waiver of privilege, depending on the circumstances of the case: at 262-263 [42]-[43]. On the facts of that case, Sackville J held that a disclosure of legal advice to the solicitors and representatives of two other companies, on strict terms as to confidentiality and for the purpose of those other companies obtaining legal advice, did not result in an imputed waiver. His Honour distinguished Goldberg v Ng as a case in which the disclosure was made to gain an advantage over the opposing party in related litigation: at 263 [45]. There are several English cases in which disclosure to a third party for a limited and specific purpose has not resulted in a loss of privilege: British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 1 WLR 1113 ( 'British Coal' ); Goldman ; and Gotha City v Southeby's (No 1) [1988] 1 WLR 1114. In British Coal , Neill LJ (with whom Stocker LJ and Dillon LJ agreed) held that the disclosure of documents by the plaintiff to the police to assist in a criminal investigation and criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege. Neill LJ said at 822: 'In my judgment the action of the plaintiff in making documents available for the purpose of the criminal trial did not constitute a waiver of the privilege to which it was entitled in the present civil proceedings. Its action in regard to both the category A and the category B documents was in accordance with its duty to assist in the conduct of the criminal proceedings, and could not properly be construed as an express or implied waiver of its rights in its own civil litigation. Indeed, it would in my view be contrary to public policy if the plaintiff's action in making the documents available in the criminal proceedings had the effect of automatically removing the cloak of privilege which would otherwise be available to them in the civil litigation for which the cloak was designed.' In Goldman , the Court of Appeal considered the effect of a statutory requirement that a claimant for costs must disclose privileged materials to the Court's taxing officers. Taylor LJ (with whom Woolf LJ and Lord Donaldson MR agreed) said that once a party puts forward privileged documents as part of his case for costs, the privilege is relaxed temporarily and pro hac vice . If the taxing officers felt compelled by natural justice considerations to disclose part or all of the contents of a privileged document to the opposite party, that disclosure would be for the purposes of the taxation only and would not amount to a waiver that prevented the owner of the document from reasserting privilege in any subsequent context: at 102. McHugh J took a stricter view in Giannarelli v Wraith (No 2) [1991] HCA 2 ; (1991) 171 CLR 592. His Honour noted that in Victoria, unlike in England, a litigant can refuse to produce documents to the taxing master on the grounds of legal professional privilege. However, McHugh J said that if the litigant choses to produce privileged documents to the taxing master, then the litigant will be taken to have waived privilege and must let the opposing parties see the documents. His Honour did not countenance any middle course under which privilege could be waived solely for the purposes of the taxation and then re-asserted in some other context: at 607. The general rule adopted in the United States is that any voluntary disclosure of privileged communications by a client to a third party breaches the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship and therefore waives the privilege, not only as to the specific communication disclosed but as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter: see Weil v Investment/Indicators Research and Management Inc 647 F2d 18 (9 th Cir 1981) at 24; United States v Aronoff 466 FSupp 855 (DC NY 1979) at 862 [9]-[10]; In re Sealed Case 676 F2d 793 (DC Cir 1982) (' re Sealed Case' ) at 809 [6] [7]; United States v AT &amp; T Co 642 F2d 1285 (DC Cir 1980) at 1299; cf Diotima Shipping Corp v Chase, Leavitt &amp; Co ., 102 F.R.D. 532 (D Me 1984); von Bulow v von Bulow , 114 F.R.D. 71 (SD NY 1987); and T Harman, Fairness and the Doctrine of Subject Matter Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege in Extrajudicial Disclosure Situations (1988) University of Illinois Law Review 999. The US courts have also considered whether a disclosure of privileged material to government investigators will have the consequence of waiving privilege. In re Sealed Case , the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia considered whether a corporation that had submitted its own investigating counsel's report into alleged bribes and improper payments to the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') pursuant to voluntary disclosure programs had thereby impliedly waived its privilege over documents which were clearly identified in the report. The Court held that, by revealing part of privileged communications to the agencies to gain a commercial advantage, the corporation had made a disclosure which was inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality. Accordingly, the Court held that the corporation had waived privilege as to all other communications relating to the same subject matter. The principle applied by the Court was that (at 818 [29]): 'Courts need not allow a claim of privilege when the party claiming the privilege seeks to use it in a way that is not consistent with the purpose of the privilege. Thus, since the purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to protect the confidentiality of attorney-client communications in order to foster candor within the attorney-client relationship, voluntary breach of confidence or selective disclosure for tactical purposes waives the privilege. Disclosure is inconsistent with confidentiality, and courts need not permit hide-and-seek manipulation of confidences in order to foster candor.' The Court rejected an argument that waiver should not be imputed because the corporation had disclosed the investigating counsel's report for specific and limited purposes only. In doing so, it declined to follow the decision in Diversified Industries Inc v Meredith 572 F2d 596 (8 th Cir 1977) ( 'Diversified Industries' ) at 611 in which the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that disclosures to the SEC under a voluntary disclosure program did not constitute a waiver to anyone but the SEC. It noted that the decision in Diversified Industries was rejected in Permian Corp v United States 665 F2d 1215 (DC Cir 1981) at 1220-1222 on the ground that it unnecessarily expanded the scope of attorney-client privilege: see also In re Weiss 596 F2d 1185 (4 th Cir 1979) at 1186. Like the District Columbia Circuit, the First, Third, Fourth, Sixth and Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal have rejected the approach adopted by the Eighth Circuit in Diversified Industries : see AM Pinto, Cooperation and Self-Interest are Strange Bedfellows: Limited Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege through Production of Privileged Documents in a Government Investigation (2004) 106 West Virginia Law Review 359, p 372; RH Porter, Voluntary Disclosures to Federal Agencies Their Impact on the Ability of Corporations to Protect from Discovery Materials Developed During the Course of Internal Investigations (1990) 39 Catholic University Law Review 1007, pp 1029-1052. The US courts have accepted that there will be no imputed or implied waiver of privilege if the disclosure of the privileged material is involuntary and compelled by law: see eg Trans America. The Canadian courts apply a waiver test that is based on considerations of fairness and consistency: see S &amp; K Processors Ltd v Campbell Ave Herring Producers Ltd (1983) CPC 146 (BCSC) at 150; Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v Canada (Director of the Canadian Museum of Nature) [1995] 3 FC 643 ; British Columbia (Securities Commission) v BDS (2000) BCJ No 2111 (BCSC), affirmed (2003) 226 DLR (4 th ) 393; and RD Manes and MP Silver, Solicitor-Client Privilege in Canadian Law , Butterworths, 1993, p 207. As in the United States, waiver will not be imputed if privileged material is produced to a government regulator under compulsion of law. Putting to one side its provision of Mr Tracey QC's advices and instructions and its briefings to the Australian Government, AWB disputed that the disclosures it made to the IIC and the Commission disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB obtained as a result of Project Rose or Project Water. It contended that these disclosures did no more than refer to the existence of legal advice, without disclosing its substance. Alternatively, AWB argued that the record of Lindberg's interview with the IIC, and the evidence given to the Commission by Lindberg, Cooper and Scales, cannot be related to any particular piece of legal advice, other than that provided by Mr Tracey QC. The applicable principles are set out in my decision in AWB v Cole at [135] [139]. The authorities draw a distinction between a mere reference to the existence of legal advice, which will not usually amount to a waiver, and cases in which the gist or substance of the legal advice has been disclosed: see Maurice at 481, 488 and 493; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd [1996] HCA 15 ; (1996) 70 ALJR 603 at 607; Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co (Canberra) Ltd (1996) 40 NSWLR 12; Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd v Spalvins (1998) 81 FCR 360 at 376-377; and Bennett v Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service [2004] FCAFC 237 ; (2004) 140 FCR 101 (' Bennett' ) at 104-105 [6] [9]. In Bennett , the Full Court (Tamberlin, Emmett and Gyles JJ) held that legal representatives of the Australian Customs Service had waived privilege in legal advice by stating openly that they had given advice to Customs that a particular regulation did not prohibit public comment by an officer on matters of public administration. The trial judge had held that a disclosure of the legal position or stance that a lawyer had advised a client to take was not inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the communication giving the advice. The trial judge also appeared to draw a distinction between statements which disclose the conclusion or logical result of legal advice, and statements which disclose the content of the legal advice and its reasoning: see Tamberlin J at 105 [10] and Gyles J at 118 [61]. The Full Court rejected this approach. Gyles J stated at 119 [65] that the voluntary disclosure of the gist or conclusion of the legal advice amounts to waiver in respect of the whole of the advice to which reference is made, including the reasons for the conclusion. Tamberlin J said at 104 [6]: 'In my view, it would be inconsistent and unfair, having disclosed and used the substance of the advice in this way, to now seek to maintain privilege in respect of the relevant parts of that advice which pertain to the expressed conclusion. It may perhaps have been different if it had been simply asserted that the client has taken legal advice and that the position which was adopted having considered the advice, is that certain action will be taken or not taken. In those circumstances, the substance of the advice is not disclosed but merely the fact that there was some advice and that it was considered. However, once the conclusion in the advice is stated, together with the effect of it, then in my view, there is imputed waiver of the privilege. The whole point of an advice is the final conclusion. This is the situation in this case.' Subsequently, Tamberlin J was confronted with a case that was very similar to the one he hypothesised in Bennett . In Nine Films and Television Pty Ltd v NINOX Television Ltd (2005) 65 IPR 442, the applicant contended that the respondents had waived privilege in various legal advices because of the way in which the respondents had publicly referred to the advice. Tamberlin J held that there had been no waiver. He concluded that the mere assertion that advice had been taken, and the fact that action is then taken by the client, is not sufficient, unless the two are linked in such a way that it is apparent that the advice is that specified action should be taken. His Honour also made the following observations at 446-447 [26]: 'Whilst I accept that, in some circumstances, a clear disclosure of the ""bottom line"" of the advice, and the course of conduct taken thereafter, may be sufficient to amount to waiver of legal professional privilege, I do not think these matters have been established in the present case. On a fair and reasonable reading, the statement to the effect that senior counsel had been engaged and that he had reviewed matters in detail and that steps were being taken based on his recommendations is not sufficient to amount to a waiver of the legal advice. The substance or content of the advice is not disclosed with specificity or clarity. Questions of waiver are matters of fact and degree and, in this instance, I am not persuaded that the conduct, assertions or admissible evidence are sufficient to warrant the necessary implication that legal professional privilege has been waived.' The principles discussed in Bennett were applied in Seven Network Ltd v News Ltd (No 12 ) [2006] FCA 348. The issue was whether a statement in a discovered document that '[o]ur legal advice is that the risk of damages being awarded against Optus is low' had the consequence of waiving privilege in the legal advice that it referred to. Sackville J held that it did; the statement voluntarily disclosed the gist or conclusion of the legal advice: at [12]. In Rio Tinto Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 224 ALR 299, the Commissioner of Taxation filed particulars with the Court stating that the Commissioner would be relying on specified grounds 'which have been confirmed by Senior Tax Counsel... and supported by AGS... and opinions obtained from counsel'. The taxpayer contended that the Commissioner had thereby waived privilege in the legal advice of the Australian Government Solicitor and the opinions of counsel. Sundberg J held that these references voluntarily disclosed the conclusion or substance of the advice and consequently privilege had been waived. Sundberg J's decision went on appeal to the Full Court, but the Full Court's decision turned on the alternative ground of issue waiver: Rio Tinto at [72]. The Full Court considered that, in the particulars, the Commissioner had made an assertion that put the contents of the documents containing legal advice in issue, or necessarily laid them open to scrutiny, with the consequence that there was an inconsistency between the making of the assertion and the maintenance of the privilege. AWB submitted that the reasoning in Bennett was unsound, particularly the holding that the disclosure of the conclusion stated in legal advice will amount to a waiver of the whole of the advice. AWB did not refer to any authorities that supported this submission and I reject it. In my view, it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of the gist, substance or conclusion of legal advice will amount to a waiver in respect of the whole of the relevant advice. ASSOCIATED MATERIAL Turning to the scope of any imputed waiver, it is well established that a voluntary disclosure of privileged documents can result in a waiver of privilege over those documents and associated material. The test applied to determine the scope of any waiver of associated material is whether the material that the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the same issue or subject matter: Maurice at 482 and 484 per Gibbs CJ, 488 per Mason and Brennan JJ, and 498 499 per Dawson J. In Maurice , Gibbs CJ said at 482: '... Similarly, where a party disclosed a document which contained part only of a memorandum which dealt with a single subject-matter, and then read the document to the judge in the course of opening the case, it was held that privilege was waived as to the whole memorandum: Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co . In that case Templeman LJ said: "" ... the rule that privilege relating to a document which deals with one subject matter cannot be waived as to part and asserted as to the remainder is based on the possibility that any use of part of a document may be unfair or misleading, that the party who possesses the document is clearly not the person who can decide whether a partial disclosure is misleading or not, nor can the judge decide without hearing argument, nor can he hear argument unless the document is disclosed as a whole to the other side. Once disclosure has taken place by introducing part of the document into evidence or using it in court it cannot be erased."" The same test must be applied in deciding whether the use in legal proceedings of one document impliedly waives privilege in associated material. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation [No 2] Mustill J dealt with this question and suggested the following test: "" ... where a party is deploying in court material which would otherwise be privileged, the opposite party and the court must have an opportunity of satisfying themselves that what the party has chosen to release from privilege represents the whole of the material relevant to the issue in question. To allow an individual item to be plucked out of context would be to risk injustice through its real weight or meaning being misunderstood.""' Dawson J discussed the authorities at 498-499: 'In Geo. Doland Ltd v Blackburn Robson Coates &amp; Co waiver of privilege with respect to a conversation between solicitor and client, which took place before litigation was contemplated, was held to extend to any other communications in relation to the subject-matters of the conversation, although the implied waiver was held not to cover similar documents which came into existence for the purpose of prosecuting the litigation. This decision was not followed in General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter where a distinction was drawn between the waiver of privilege before a trial and the further waiver of privilege by calling evidence in a trial. In the latter situation the waiver was held to extend to the transaction constituted by the privileged communication but not to the subject-matter of that communication arising upon other privileged occasions. General Accident Corporation Ltd v Tanter has been criticized for the distinction which it draws between waiver by the tender of evidence of a privileged communication and waiver by the disclosure of the communication in some other way and for the restriction which it places upon the extent of associative waiver: see Phipson on Evidence , par 15-20. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation [No 2] , a broader view was taken by Mustill J that "" ... where a party chooses to deploy evidence which would otherwise be privileged the court and the opposition must, in relation to the issue in question, be given the opportunity to satisfy themselves that they have the whole of the material and not merely a fragment"". This view was approved by the Court of Appeal in Great Atlantic Insurance Co v Home Insurance Co . In the United States it has been widely held that voluntary disclosure of the content of a privileged attorney communication constitutes waiver of the privilege with respect to all other such communications upon the same subject-matter: Weil v Investment/Indicators, Research and Management and the cases there cited; Diotima Shipping Corp v Chase, Leavitt &amp; Co ; United States v Aronoff ; In re Sealed Case .' AWB relied upon the way in which the principle was formulated by the Court of Appeal in British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd v Cowell [2002] VSCA 197 ; (2002) 7 VR 524 at 564 [121] : 'A reference in one letter of advice to an earlier letter of advice does not expose the latter to scrutiny by the other party to litigation merely because legal professional privilege is waived in relation to the former: implied waiver is not so generous a doctrine. As we apprehend it, where legal professional privilege is waived in relation to one piece (or part) of advice, the privilege is impliedly waived in relation to another if - and only if - that other is necessary to a proper understanding of the first. As established by the High Court (at least since Mann v. Carnell ) the test in such cases is whether it would be ""inconsistent"" for a party to rely upon, and so to waive legal professional privilege in respect of, the one without also being taken to have waived privilege in respect of the other.' It is no doubt correct that a mere reference to the existence of legal advice in a disclosed document will not be regarded as a waiver of its contents, albeit a different conclusion would follow if the gist, substance or conclusion of the legal advice is voluntarily disclosed. But, with great respect to their Honours, the proposition concerning waiver of associated material is expressed too narrowly and in a way that is not consistent with the test propounded by the High Court in Maurice . The principle propounded by the Court of Appeal may work adequately enough in some circumstances, particularly where privilege is sought to be maintained over one part of a single piece of legal advice, but in other circumstances it will not give effect to the principles explained in Maurice. A common application of associated material waiver relates to the case where an expert report has been prepared in reliance upon other documents. In Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Southcorp Ltd (2003) 46 ACSR 438 at 441-442 [21], Lindgren J summarised the applicable principles: '1. Ordinarily the confidential briefing or instructing by a prospective litigant's lawyers of an expert to provide a report of his or her opinion to be used in the anticipated litigation attracts client legal privilege: cf Wheeler v Le Marchant (1881) 17 Ch D 675; Trade Practices Commission v Sterling (1979) 36 FLR 244 at 246; Interchase Corp Ltd (in liq) v Grosvenor Hill (Qld) Pty Ltd (No 1) [1999] 1 Qd R 141 (Interchase) at 151 per Pincus JA, at 160 per Thomas J. 2. Copies of documents, whether the originals are privileged or not, where the copies were made for the purpose of forming part of confidential communications between the client's lawyers and the expert witness, ordinarily attract the privilege: Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 (Propend)...; Interchase , per Pincus JA; Spassked Pty Ltd v Cmr of Taxation (No 4) (2002) 50 ATR 70 at [17]. 3. Documents generated unilaterally by the expert witness, such as working notes, field notes, and the witness's own drafts of his or her report, do not attract privilege because they are not in the nature of, and would not expose, communications: cf Interchase at 161-2 per Thomas J. 4. Ordinarily disclosure of the expert's report for the purpose of reliance on it in the litigation will result in an implied waiver of the privilege in respect of the brief or instructions or documents referred to in (1) and (2) above, at least if the appropriate inference to be drawn is that they were used in a way that could be said to influence the content of the report, because, in these circumstances, it would be unfair for the client to rely on the report without disclosure of the brief, instructions or documents; cf Attorney-General (NT) v Maurice [1986] HCA 80 ; (1986) 161 CLR 475 at 481... per Gibbs CJ, CLR 487--488... per Mason and Brennan JJ, CLR 492-493... per Deane J, CLR 497--498... per Dawson J; Goldberg v Ng [1995] HCA 39 ; (1995) 185 CLR 83 at 98... per Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ, CLR 109... per Toohey J; Instant Colour Pty Ltd v Canon Australia Pty Ltd [1995] FCA 870... ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Lux Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 89... at [46] . 5. Similarly, privilege cannot be maintained in respect of documents used by an expert to form an opinion or write a report, regardless of how the expert came by the documents; Interchase at 148--150 per Pincus JA, at 161 per Thomas J. 6. It may be difficult to establish at an early stage whether documents which were before an expert witness influenced the content of his or her report, in the absence of any reference to them in the report: cf Dingwall v Commonwealth of Australia (1992) 39 FCR 521; Tirango Nominees Pty Ltd v Dairy Vale Foods Ltd (No 2) (1998) 83 FCR 397 at 400;... ACCC v Lux at [46].' In Thomas v New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 380 (' Thomas' ), McClellan CJ at Common Law applied these principles to the documents which underpinned or supported the advice of counsel. His Honour stated at [17]: 'Although in the present case the primary document for which privilege was expressly waived was the advice of counsel, I can discern no difference in principle between such an advice and the advice or report of an expert retained for the purpose of the litigation. As I have indicated, I am satisfied that counsel relied upon instructions which they were given and, it would appear, relied upon medical reports in a way which influenced the content of the advice which they gave. Accordingly, insofar as there are documents which were relied upon in the preparation of the advice falling within categories 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the notice to produce, the service of the affidavit impliedly waived privilege in those documents.' Later at [20] his Honour said: '... In the present case the plaintiff disclosed the advice in these proceedings for the purpose of obtaining whatever assistance he could from that advice in pursuit of his claim. To my mind, that disclosure waived his privilege both in the advice itself and the documents which were used by counsel and which influenced the content of the advice. Waiver having occurred, the fact that the advice was not ultimately tendered is, to my mind, not relevant. Having sought an advantage, the plaintiff was bound by the course he had taken and accordingly is amenable to producing the relevant documents in response to an appropriate notice to produce.' In Newcrest Mining (WA) Limited v Commonwealth (1993) 40 FCR 507, French J applied the principle of associated material waiver in a case where one joint venturer disclosed significant elements of legal advice it had obtained in relation to mining leases held by the joint venture partners. His Honour held that the disclosure brought about an implied waiver of other legal advices obtained by the other joint venturers in relation to the mining leases. His Honour said at 509 that it was significant that the disclosures were made for the benefit of the joint venture as a whole and, although there was no direct evidence on the point, he considered that it was difficult to imagine that the disclosures would have occurred against the wishes of the other joint venturers or indeed without their consent. In England, the principle has been applied to documents which underpin or support expert evidence: see Dunlop Slazenger International Ltd v Joe Bloggs Sports Limited [2003] EDWCA Civ 901; Mayne Pharma Pty Ltd v Debiopharm SA [2006] EWHC 164 (Pat); and L'Oreal SA v Bellure NV [2006] EWHC 1503 (Ch). Several English cases illustrate the practical operation of the principle. In Nea Karteria Maritime Co Ltd v Atlantic &amp; Great Lakes Steamship Corporation (No 2) [1981] Com LR 138 (' Nea Karteria' ), a lawyer gave evidence that he had conducted an interview on the basis of a list of questions prepared by the plaintiffs' lawyers. While privilege was waived with respect to the witnesses' answers, the plaintiffs sought to maintain privilege with respect to the list of questions: at 139-140. Mustill J (as his Lordship then was) held at 140 that privilege over the list of questions had been waived by implication: 'It seems to me that the written questions were, so to speak, part of the meeting. They were in a sense an agenda for the meeting. They formed the basis for one-half of the exchange between the lawyer and [the witness]. Evidence to that effect having been given by the lawyer, it seems to me that privilege must have been waived for those questions. And I think the interests of justice, which I believe to underlie the authorities on this part of the case, demand that the opposition and the court should have an opportunity to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the evidence given to the lawyer as to the way in which he conducted the interview.' Mustill J drew a distinction at 140 between the instructions to the lawyer who carried out the questioning and the questions themselves; the instructions did not play a part in the meeting, did not form part of the body of events upon which the Court had to reach conclusions of fact, and were merely part of the prior history of those events. In R v Secretary of State for Transport; Ex parte Factortame (1997) 9 Admin LR 591 at 599, Auld LJ made the following observations concerning the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria : 'Much depends on whether the party making partial disclosure seeks to represent by so doing that the disclosed documents go to part or the whole of an ""issue in question"", the expression used by Mustill, J in the passage from his judgment in Nea Karteria that I have cited. The issue may be confined to what was said or done in a single transaction or it may be more complex than that and extend over a series of connected events or transactions. In each case the question for the court is whether the matters in issue and the document or documents in respect of which partial disclosure has been made are respectively severable so that the partially disclosed material clearly does not bear on matters in issue in respect of which material is withheld. The more confined the issue, for example as to the content of a single document or conversation, the more difficult it is likely to be to withhold, by severance, part of the document or other documents relevant to the document or conversation.' In Fulham Leisure Holdings Ltd v Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones [2006] 2 All ER 599 (' Fulham' ) at 604 [11], Mann J suggested that it was helpful to approach the application of the test stated in Nea Karteria in three steps: first, identify the transaction in respect of which the disclosure has been made; secondly, ascertain from the nature of the disclosure or other evidence whether the transaction is wider than an advice given on a single occasion, if so, the whole of the wider transaction must be disclosed; and thirdly, the disclosure of the whole transaction may make it plain that further disclosure is necessary to avoid unfairness or misunderstanding of what has been disclosed. Mann J added at 607 [18] that once the transaction has been identified the cases show that the whole of the material relevant to that transaction must be disclosed. It is not open to a waiving party to say that the transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose; the court will determine objectively what the real transaction is so that the scope of the waiver can be determined. His Lordship also said that the application of these principles will be very fact sensitive and will vary from case to case: at 607 [19]. WAIVER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED At [70] to [126] above, I set out my findings as to the precise terms in which AWB disclosed the results of its legal reviews and legal advice it had obtained to the Australian Government, the IIC and the Commission. Overall, I am satisfied that by means of these disclosures, AWB deployed the gist or substance of legal advice it had obtained. Moreover, I am satisfied that AWB made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice in its dealings with the Australian Government, the IIC and the Commission because it considered that it was in its commercial interests to do so. These actions are inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in the legal advice. Having regard to the nature, purpose, terms and extent of its disclosures, I am also satisfied that AWB acted inconsistently with the maintenance of confidentiality over the associated material which underpinned the legal advice. While these overall conclusions are relevant and important, I have taken the view that it is necessary and appropriate for me to make specific findings as to the nature and consequences of each such disclosure. I turn to that task. In his various statements to the Australian Government, Hargreaves did not merely refer to the existence of legal advice. Nor did he simply disclose the legal advice which had been obtained by AWB from Mr Tracey QC. He described in some detail the findings and conclusions that had been arrived at by AWB's own legal review. In my opinion, Hargreaves thereby disclosed to the Australian Government the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB had obtained (as at the relevant dates at which he made his disclosures) that there was no evidence of: &#8226; corruption by AWB &#8226; side payments or after sales payments by AWB to the former Iraqi regime &#8226; any knowledge on the part of AWB that Alia was connected with the Iraqi regime or that payments were being channelled by Alia to that regime &#8226; any conduct by AWB that resulted in breaches of the United Nations' sanctions &#8226; any other wrongdoing or improper conduct by AWB in connection with the supply of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme. When Hargreaves gave his briefings to officers of the Australian Government, he expressed himself in terms that were apt to refer, and which a reasonable listener would have understood as referring, to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that AWB had received as at the date of the relevant briefing. Hargreaves would not have been understood as referring only to a particular piece of historical advice, regardless of whether it was overtaken, or qualified, or supported by later advice. His assertions purported to represent the current state of affairs. Hargreaves' memorandum of 25 June 2005 makes it quite clear that his statements to the Australian Government were based upon all of the legal advice AWB had obtained, and not simply the advice it had obtained from Mr Tracey QC. It cannot be disputed that Hargreaves disclosed the substance of the legal advice which Blakes provided to AWB's board on 25 May 2004. AWB has already formed that view and acted on it by producing Blakes' power point presentation to the Commission. But in my view the consequence of Hargreaves' disclosures cannot be confined to Blakes' advice of 25 May 2004 and Mr Tracey QC's advices. Through the remainder of 2004 and until Hargreaves had his last meeting with Ms Carayanides in the period between 16 June 2005 and September 2005, Hargreaves met with Australian Government representatives several times and continued to make assertions that AWB's independent legal review had not identified any wrongdoing by AWB. The evidence shows that Blakes and Minters continued the legal review in 2004 and 2005 and provided ongoing legal advice to AWB. It is not open to a waiving party to say that the disclosures relate simply to one advice and not others, or that the relevant transaction is simply what the party has chosen to disclose; the Court will determine objectively what has been disclosed: see Fulham at 607 [18]. Hargreaves' memorandum of 25 June 2005 makes it plain that he deliberately deployed AWB's legal advice in his dealings with the Australian Government. He did so as part of AWB's strategy to secure the continued support of the Federal Government, both generally and in relation to AWB's dealings with the IIC and the United States Government. Hargreaves also deployed the advice in pursuit of the objectives that he set out in his memorandum; they included protecting and defending the reputation of AWB both within Australia and overseas, and minimising any attack by US wheat interests on AWB's position as the exclusive manager of wheat exports from Australia. Given these strategic objectives, it was important for AWB to disclose, indeed to stress, that it had conducted an extensive independent legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing by AWB in connection with its exports of wheat to Iraq. By disclosing its legal advice to secure these objectives, AWB assumed the risk that it would be held to have waived legal professional privilege in connection with legal advices it obtained in the course of the legal review. Having regard to the legal principles governing waiver, I consider that any legal advice that AWB obtained from Blakes or Minters prior to Hargreaves' last meeting with Ms Carayanides on any of the subject matters, or relating to any of the issues, described at [180] above, has been waived by reason of the disclosures made by Hargreaves. Those subject matters and issues are wide enough to encompass the Tigris transaction and the iron filings claim. If AWB obtained legal advice during this period on those subject matters, or relating to those issues, from persons other than Blakes or Minters such as ABL, Mr Tracey QC or others, that advice has also been waived by Hargreaves' disclosures. I am satisfied that the disclosures to the IIC involved a disclosure by AWB of the gist or substance of legal advice that it had obtained by 28 February 2005. The disclosure occurred at two points. First, when Lindberg was interviewed on 28 February 2005, the interview took place in the presence of AWB's legal representative. AWB had the ability to object to any statements by Lindberg that intruded into areas covered by legal professional privilege. No objection was raised to Lindberg's statement that the legal review conducted by Cooper had found nothing that would substantiate claims of fraud or corruption by AWB or payments by AWB to individuals in the Government of Iraq. Secondly, AWB was directly involved in providing the record of interview, as revised by Lindberg and AWB's lawyers, to the IIC. In my opinion, the record of interview describes the gist or substance of legal advice which AWB had obtained as a result of its legal review. As with Hargreaves, Lindberg's assertions purported to describe the current state of affairs, ie, as at 28 February 2005. There is no reason to read his assertions as if they were confined to legal advice obtained from Mr Tracey QC. It extends, in my view, to any legal advice obtained by AWB from Blakes, Minters and Mr Tracey QC, and any advice from others, prior to 28 February 2005 that deals with the same subject matters or relates to the same issues as the advice that Lindberg described. I am satisfied that the disclosures to the IIC were made deliberately and consciously by AWB with a view to obtaining a finding from the IIC that AWB had not engaged, or at least had not knowingly engaged, in conduct that involved making payments to the Iraqi regime in breach of the United Nations' sanctions. Lindberg and AWB went out of their way to stress that the company had undertaken a legal review which had found nothing to substantiate claims of fraud, corruption or improper payments to the Iraqi regime. The disclosures were made with the knowledge and intention that they would be referred to by the IIC in its final published report. Accordingly, I find that AWB consciously and voluntarily deployed its legal advice with the object and intention of furthering the company's commercial and other interests. AWB contended that the disclosures which Lindberg made at his meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 4 October 2005 were confined to the advice given by Mr Tracey QC. This is a possible interpretation of the Department's minute, but in my view Lindberg's statements are not to be read, and would not have been understood, so narrowly. Later in the meeting, Lindberg said that AWB had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime and that this had been supported by legal advice. This statement was expressed broadly and was not confined to 'independent legal advice'. In my view, Lindberg disclosed, and a reasonable listener would have understood that Lindberg was disclosing, the gist or substance of all of the legal advice that AWB had obtained up to 4 October 2005 in relation to the question whether AWB had acted in accordance with the sanctions regime. The disclosure extends to Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of advice dated 22 September 2005 and Professor Wippman's advice dated 27 September 2005. At the meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lindberg, Stewart and other representatives of AWB were providing AWB's answer to the IIC's draft findings, as communicated to AWB in the IIC's letter of 26 September 2005. The minute shows that AWB's representatives were very concerned to explain AWB's claims of innocence and to secure the Government's ongoing support. Lindberg told the meeting that the IIC had ignored AWB's explanations and that the so-called evidence relied on by the IIC did not support its factual findings. In support of these contentions, Lindberg asserted that AWB had legal advice confirming that AWB had not acted in contravention of the sanctions regime. I infer that AWB made a conscious and voluntary decision to deploy this legal advice at the meeting with the Minister so as to secure the ongoing support of the Australian Government. In doing so, it assumed the risk of any consequential waiver of legal professional privilege. In my opinion, Blakes' presentation to AWB's board on 25 May 2004 constituted legal advice for the purposes of the doctrine of legal professional privilege. AWB withdrew its claim of privilege and produced the complete presentation to the Commissioner in April this year. The presentation not only discloses the substance of the legal advice from Blakes, but also some of its detail and foundations. In my opinion, one consequence of this disclosure is that AWB has waived privilege over any other legal advice that it obtained prior to 25 May 2004 in relation to the same subject matters or the same issues as Blakes addressed in its presentation. AWB contends that Lindberg's evidence to the Commission on 17 January 2006 did not disclose the gist or conclusion of any legal advice. I disagree. In my opinion, it disclosed the gist or substance of legal advice that AWB had previously obtained as to whether AWB had engaged in conduct in breach of the United Nations' sanctions and whether AWB had paid inland transportation fees to Alia as a conduit for the payment of money to the Iraqi regime. In the course of his evidence, Lindberg went out of his way to assert that the legal review that Cooper had instituted, assisted by external legal advisers, had reported periodically and did not find any evidence to substantiate the allegations that AWB had made payments in breach of the sanctions. In one instance at least, Lindberg's assertions to this effect were not directly responsive to the question asked of him by counsel assisting the Commission. Lindberg gave these answers in the presence of counsel for AWB without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. I am satisfied that, by means of this evidence, AWB voluntarily deployed the legal advice that it had obtained prior to 17 January 2006. I infer that it did so because it considered it was in its interests for it to be publicly known that AWB had conducted an extensive legal review which had found no evidence of any wrongdoing. In his evidence, Lindberg specifically referred to a series of periodical reports from those undertaking the legal review: 'there were a number of reports, and the findings of those reports are recorded in the minutes and the basis of those findings has been communicated in letters that have been sent to the government and elsewhere'. I find that in his evidence to the Commission Lindberg was referring to the combined effect of all of the legal advice that AWB received during the course of the internal review as periodical reports were made to the boards of AWB and AWBI. It follows, in my view, that Lindberg's evidence has the consequence that AWB has waived privilege over any legal advice that it obtained in the course of the review that goes to the same subject matters, or relates to the same issues, as the legal advice that Lindberg described in the course of his evidence. In relation to Mr Tracey QC's advices, AWB produced his written advices of 8 June 2004, 31 March 2005 and 12 August 2005 to the Commission early in April 2006. In my view, the consequence of this production is that AWB must be taken to have waived legal professional privilege in any other legal advices that it obtained prior to Mr Tracey QC's last advice of 12 August 2005 in relation to the same subjects or issues. As already mentioned, I also consider that, quite separately, AWB has waived privilege over the advice it obtained from Mr Tracey QC on 22 September 2005 in relation to Resolution 661. As a result of the Project Water investigations, the directors of AWB obtained legal advice from Cooper at the board meeting on 14 December 2004 that the Tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches of law. A handwritten note of that advice has been produced to the Commission. AWB was entitled to claim that this note was protected from production to the Commission by legal professional privilege. It did not claim privilege. I infer that it did not do so because it wanted it to be known publicly that AWB had advice as of 14 December 2004 to the effect that the Tigris transaction complied with all necessary laws and involved no breaches by AWB. Having disclosed the gist or substance of its legal advice in this manner, it would be inconsistent to allow AWB to maintain confidentiality and privilege in any other legal advices that AWB obtained prior to 14 December 2004 dealing with the same subject matter or the same issues. The advice that Cooper gave to AWB's board on 14 December 2004 related specifically to the Tigris transaction. However, I consider that the other disclosures that I have already discussed were expressed in such broad terms that they encompassed any advices concerning the Tigris transaction and/or the iron filings claim. As a result, I consider that there has been a waiver of other advices about the Tigris transaction, such as Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of 26 October 2004 (document 353A). The cumulative effect of AWB's disclosures is that, down to 17 January 2006 when Lindberg gave evidence to the Commission, AWB was openly claiming that its legal advice showed that there was no evidence that it had engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with its supply of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme, including wrongdoing of the kind described at [180] above. I find that AWB made these claims to advance its commercial interests. AWB's conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in any advices dealing with the same subjects or issues. In addition, Lindberg, Cooper and Scales gave evidence to the Commission that AWB obtained legal advice that the proceeds of the inflated prices in contracts A1670 and A1680 should be disbursed to Tigris to the extent of approximately US$7 million. That evidence was given in the presence of AWB's legal representatives without any objection being raised on grounds of legal professional privilege. Again, I infer that AWB was content for it to be publicly known that it had obtained that legal advice. Having disclosed the gist or substance of that advice, AWB is bound to disclose any other legal advices it obtained in relation to the same subject or same issue. AWB's revised list of privileged documents contains several advices relating to the Tigris payment. They include documents 337 and 385. Documents 1088, 1089, 1092, 1093 and 1094 record the substance of those advices in minutes of meetings held by the AWB and AWBI boards in December 2004 and February 2005 and the chairman's running sheets for the February 2005 meetings. The evidence which Lindberg, Cooper and Scales gave in public before the Commission is inconsistent with AWB's attempt to maintain privilege in these documents. One question which remains to be dealt with is whether the scope of the waiver that must, in my view, be imputed to AWB is to be confined to any other legal advice that AWB obtained prior to the date of the relevant disclosures that addressed the same subject matters or issues as the advice that AWB voluntarily disclosed. In my opinion, the waiver is not so confined. It extends to the documents and information which were taken into account in formulating, or which otherwise underpinned or influenced, the legal advice that AWB has chosen to disclose. The Commonwealth argued that AWB's disclosures are broad enough to encompass any legal advice which AWB obtained, and any documents which AWB's lawyers reviewed or created, in the course of the Project Rose and Project Water investigations. The difficulty with this way of approaching the boundaries of the waiver of associated material is that the terms 'Project Rose' and 'Project Water' have an indefinite and imprecise ambit. According to the authorities discussed above, the limits of any waiver of associated material depend upon the nature of the advice that has been disclosed, what was represented by means of the disclosure, and the character of the transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice. Regard must also be had to the way in which AWB's legal advice was described in the various disclosures. Essentially, by means of the disclosures, AWB was asserting that a detailed legal review had been undertaken, and that it had concluded that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing or other improper conduct by AWB in connection with its sale of wheat to Iraq under the OFF Programme. In my opinion, the nature and character of this disclosure is inconsistent with the maintenance of confidentiality in those documents which were taken into account by AWB's legal advisers in arriving at the advice they gave. To adapt the language used by McClellan CJ at Common Law in Thomas at [17] and [20], AWB's disclosures of its legal advice effect a waiver of privilege in the documents which were reviewed for the purposes of that advice or which influenced its content. Furthermore, AWB emphasised the breadth of its internal review in its various disclosures. In my view, AWB thereby waived privilege in documents which define the scope of the review or which reveal what investigations were in fact undertaken in the course of the review. Much the same answer follows if one asks what was the legal exercise or transaction that gave rise to the disclosed legal advice: see Factortame at 598-599; and Fulham at 604 [11] and 607 [18]. Having regard to the form of the legal advice disclosed by AWB, the relevant legal exercise or transaction encompassed a review of original documents and witness interviews, as well as summaries, chronologies or other analytical documents prepared by the lawyers, with a view to determining whether there was any improper or wrongful conduct by AWB. Material of this kind underpinned or influenced the legal advice which AWB has chosen to disclose, and it is not severable from that advice. There is a certain symmetry in defining the boundaries of the waiver of associated material in this way. Documents brought into existence in the course of a lawyer's factual investigation are, prima facie, capable of attracting legal professional privilege where the investigation is being undertaken for the dominant purpose of providing legal advice. If the client voluntarily discloses the gist or substance of the legal advice that is founded upon such investigations, the rationale for according privilege to the investigative material will have disappeared. While I would go further, the approach that I have described is not unlike the approach that AWB has already taken in connection with the production to the Commission of Mr Tracey QC's memoranda of advice and instructions. In the case of Mr Tracey QC's oral advice of 25 May 2004 and his confirmatory memorandum of 12 August 2005, AWB determined, correctly in my view, that the underlying documents supplied to Mr Tracey QC must also be produced. AWB considered that the form of Mr Tracey QC's advice (ie there was no evidence of wrongdoing) meant that it was impossible to separate his legal advice from the copy documents that were supplied to him as part of his instructions. The evidence before me does not reveal whether AWB adopted the same approach to Mr Tracey QC's advice of 31 March 2005. When he was asked to provide this advice, copy documents were supplied to Mr Tracey QC as part of his instructions but there is no evidence, one way or the other, as to whether those copy documents have been produced to the Commission. The substance of Mr Tracey QC's advice was that nothing in the documents supplied to him as of 31 March 2005 had caused him to vary his earlier advice of 25 May 2004. This advice cannot be separated from the documents that were supplied to him and, accordingly, AWB's express waiver of privilege in his advice extends to all of the documents and instructions supplied to him. The applicable principle can also be illustrated by reference to the advice that Blakes gave in its presentation of 25 May 2004. The advice that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by AWB that involved a breach of the United Nations' sanctions was explicitly founded upon a review of a large number of documents and interviews of AWB personnel. Having regard to the form of its advice, it is impossible to separate Blakes' advice from the underlying documentation and interviews. However, the witness interviews and other materials that Blakes relied upon to formulate its advice have not been produced to the Commission and are still the subject of claims for legal professional privilege. In my opinion, those claims of privilege are not maintainable; privilege has been waived by (inter alia) the production of Blakes' advice. The same approach must be adopted to any advices that Blakes provided after 25 May 2004 on the question whether any evidence had emerged of any wrongdoing or improper conduct on the part of AWB. Another question which remains to be dealt with is the extent of any waiver that arises from AWB's production to the Commission of the instructions to Sir Anthony Mason. In its particulars setting forth its objections to AWB's privilege claims, the Commonwealth contended that these disclosures had brought about a waiver of legal professional privilege in relation to Project Rose. It tendered the instructions which ABL provided to Sir Anthony Mason on 16 September and 20 October 2005 and the expert opinion which Sir Anthony Mason provided dated 24 October 2005. However, the Commonwealth did not direct any submissions to this aspect of its waiver case, either orally or in its written submissions. Nor did AWB address any oral or written submissions to the consequences which flowed from its production to the Commission of the instructions to, and the advice obtained from, Sir Anthony Mason. It must be borne in mind that AWB is seeking a declaration that all of the documents set forth in its revised list of privileged documents are the subject of legal professional privilege. These documents include documents by which AWB obtained legal advice both in Australia and in the United States concerning the applicability of Resolution 661. The instructions to Sir Anthony Mason summarised the gist or substance of the very same legal advice. In these circumstances, I have concluded that the Court must take account of the evidence that has been placed before it. By disclosing the instructions given to Sir Anthony Mason, AWB has in my opinion disclosed the substance of legal advice it had obtained, as at 20 October 2005, both in Australia and in the United States, as to the applicability of Resolution 661. This disclosure encompasses Mr Tracey QC's memorandum of 22 September 2005 and Professor Wippman's advice of 27 September 2005. Thus far, I have identified the principles which define the boundaries of the waiver that is to be imputed to AWB, including the boundaries of any waiver of associated material. The remaining task in disposing of the waiver arguments is to determine precisely what documents fall within these boundaries. I have carried out that task by inspecting the documents over which claims of privilege have been made, reviewing the evidence concerning each document, and applying the principles identified above. As a result, I have determined that AWB has waived any legal professional privilege that would otherwise attach to the documents as listed under the heading 'Conclusions' below. THE IRON FILINGS CLAIM Communications between a lawyer and client which facilitate a crime or fraud are not protected by legal professional privilege. This principle is often referred to as the 'fraud exception' to legal professional privilege, but this does not capture its full reach: Attorney-General (NT) v Kearney [1985] HCA 60 ; (1985) 158 CLR 500 (' Kearney' ) at 515; Propend at 546; Clements, Dunne &amp; Bell Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2001) 188 ALR 515 (' Clements' ) at 521-522 [30]. The principle encompasses a wide species of fraud, criminal activity or actions taken for illegal or improper purposes: see North J's review of the authorities in Clements at 522-526 [35]-[44]. The scope of conduct caught by the principle has been articulated in a variety of ways, often without particular precision: Propend at 545. Classic formulations have spoken of communications in furtherance of a 'crime or fraud': R v Cox and Railton (1884) 14 QBD 153 (' R v Cox' ) at 165; a 'criminal or unlawful proceeding': Bullivant v Attorney-General (Vic) [1901] AC 196 (' Bullivant' ) at 201; 'any unlawful or wicked act': Annesley v Anglesea (1743) 17 St Tr 1139 at 1229; and 'all forms of fraud and dishonesty such as fraudulent breach of trust, fraudulent conspiracy, trickery, and sham contrivances': Crescent Farm (Sidcup) Sports Ltd v Sterling Offices Ltd [1972] Ch 553 at 565. In Kearney , the High Court applied the principle to deny legal professional privilege to legal advice obtained by the Northern Territory Government which was prima facie a 'deliberate abuse of statutory power' to defeat a land claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (Cth). In his reasons for judgment, Gibbs CJ (with whom Mason and Brennan JJ agreed) stated at 515 that 'legal professional privilege will be denied to a communication which is made for the purpose of frustrating the processes of the law itself, even though no crime or fraud is contemplated.' Some authorities have expressed the principle as applicable to prevent a 'fraud on justice' in a broad sense. The concept of a 'fraud on justice' was adopted by Lander J in Gartner v Carter [2004] FCA 258 (' Gartner v Carter' ) to deny protection to a communication between a lawyer and client for the purpose of the client putting assets beyond the reach of the legitimate claims of secured creditors: at [130] and [139]-[140]. The principle extends to 'trickery' and 'shams'. A 'sham' refers to steps which take the form of a legally effective transaction but which the parties intend should not have the apparent, or any, legal consequences: Equuscorp Pty Ltd v Glengallan Investments Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 55 ; (2004) 218 CLR 471; see also Beazley v Steinhardt (1999) 106 A Crim R 21; affirmed on appeal in [1999] FCA 1255 (' Beazley' ). The recent case of Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission v Mercorella (No 3) [2006] FCA 772 provides an example of the denial of legal professional privilege to documents in furtherance of a sham transaction. In that case, creditors of a managed investment scheme claimed privilege over documents relating to securities obtained from the defendant and certain companies in the scheme. The transactions were allegedly entered into so as to advance those creditors' interests over the interests of other creditors to the scheme. Mansfield J found that the communications were prima facie in furtherance of a sham and, as such, were not privileged. After referring to Lander J's decision in Gartner v Carter and Barclays Bank plc v Eustice [1995] 4 All ER 511 (' Barclays Bank '), his Honour stated at [95]: 'It is a short step from those decisions to the present facts, as prima facie found. The [creditors] engaged in the transactions reflected in the Deed, and the granting of the securities within the structures it created, to secure or advance their interests over others who had advanced money to [the first defendant] or to the Scheme. There is a prima facie case that the ""restructure"" of the advances so that they appear as advances to the partnership of Ajay and Opey is a sham.' Mansfield J drew a distinction at [96]-[100] between communications to obtain advice in relation to what, if anything, could lawfully be done to improve the prospects of being repaid or of obtaining the interest to which the client was entitled (which were privileged), and communications which have the effect of concealing the true nature of a transaction and which enable a client to present a picture which is not true (which were not privileged). Where a client is engaged in fraudulent conduct, communications with his or her lawyer in furtherance of the fraud are not privileged, regardless of whether the lawyer is a party to the fraud or not: Clements at 562 [213]. The principle applies to communications passing between a client and lawyer where the lawyer is innocent of the fraud or improper purpose: R v Bell; Ex parte Lees [1980] HCA 26 ; (1980) 146 CLR 141 at 145. Further, the fraud need not be that of the client or the lawyer; it may be that of a third party: Capar v Commissioner of Police (1994) 34 NSWLR 715; R v Central Criminal Court; Ex parte Francis &amp; Francis [1989] AC 346, cited with approval in Clements at 562-565 [217]-[218]. It is important to bear in mind that the fraud exception is based on public policy grounds. The principle is sufficiently flexible to capture a range of situations where the protection of confidential communications between lawyer and client would be contrary to the public interest: see Kearney at 514-515; R v Cox at 614. This aspect of the principle is reflected in the statement that '[t]he privilege takes flight if the relationship between lawyer and client is abused': Clark v United States (1933) 289 US 1 at 15; see also Kearney at 514 and 524. In Barclays Bank , communications between the client and his lawyer in relation to the setting up of transactions at an undervalue so as to prejudice the bank were held to be 'sufficiently iniquitous for public policy' to require those communications to be discoverable. Schiemann LJ (with whom Aldous and Butler-Sloss LJJ agreed) stated at 524: 'If that view be correct, then it matters not whether either the client or the solicitor shared that view. They may well have thought that the transactions would not fall to be set aside ... either because they thought that the transactions were not at an undervalue or because they thought that the court would not find that the purpose of the transactions was to prejudice the bank. But if this is what they thought then there is a strong prima facie case that they were wrong. Public policy does not require the communications of those who misapprehend the law to be privileged in circumstances where no privilege attaches to those who correctly understand the situation.' For the principle to apply, there must be more than a mere assertion or allegation of fraud or impropriety: Bullivant at 201, 203 and 204-205. In Propend at 514, Brennan CJ expressed the test as being one of 'reasonable grounds for believing' that the relevant communication was for an improper purpose. The requirement has also been described as one of a 'prima facie case': Butler v Board of Trade [1971] 1 Ch 680 (' Butler' ) at 689; cf Baker v Evans (1987) 77 ALR 565 at 574. In Kearney at 516, Gibbs CJ approved the test formulated in O'Rourke v Darbishire [1920] AC 581 at 604, namely that 'there must be something to give colour to the charge'; 'the statement must be made in clear and definite terms, and there must further be some prima facie evidence that it has some foundation in fact'. The High Court in Propend applied this test: at 514 per Brennan CJ, at 521 per Dawson J, 534 per Toohey J, 546 per Gaudron J, 556 per McHugh J, and 592 per Kirby J. It is not necessary to prove an improper purpose on the balance of probabilities. The 'prima facie' test arguably reflects the fact that issues of legal professional privilege are usually dealt with in the interlocutory stages of a proceeding, but the authorities have not departed from that formulation where a declaration is sought in relation to privilege issues: Butler ; Propend; Beazley . It must also be established, on the same prima facie basis, that the communication which is the subject of the claim for privilege was made in furtherance of, or as a step preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or wrongdoing. In Butler, Goff J found at 687 that a letter written by the plaintiff's lawyer which volunteered a warning that the plaintiff may incur serious consequences if he did not take care was not shown to be 'in preparation for or in furtherance of or as part of any criminal designs on the part of the plaintiff': see also Zemanek v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (unreported, Federal Court, Hill J, 2 October 1997). In Propend , the High Court considered whether a charge of improper purpose must be based on evidence that is admissible in the proceeding. The only evidence of alleged illegality before the trial judge in Propend was the sworn information which supported the issue of a search warrant for the relevant documents. The Court held that, while the sworn information was admissible to establish the basis upon which the warrant was issued, it was not admissible to show that the copy documents were not privileged: see at 514 per Brennan CJ, 557 per McHugh J, 576 per Gummow J, 547 per Gaudron J, and 593 per Kirby J. The iron filings claim refers to a claim by GBI for a rebate of US$2,016,133.00 on account of the fact that earlier shipments of wheat by AWB to GBI had been contaminated by iron filings. Lindberg agreed to pay this sum to GBI in settlement of the iron filings claim in about October 2002 during the course of a visit to Bagdad. An email dated 7 November 2002 from Chris Whitwell of AWB ('Whitwell') to Lindberg and others reporting on the trip to Iraq in October 2002 stated that the responsible Iraqi Minister had asked for repayment of the iron filings rebate through the 'inland transport mechanism'. The same email referred to the fact that the Iraqi Minister was seeking cabinet approval for repayment of the Tigris debt. At the outset of this case, the Commonwealth contended that any legal advice that AWB obtained in connection with the Tigris transaction was waived by virtue of AWB's production to the Commission of a partly masked memorandum of 7 February 2003 dealing with the subject of the iron filings payment and Tigris petroleum fee. On the first day of the hearing, AWB announced that it was no longer seeking a declaration of privilege in respect of documents connected with the Tigris transaction which the Commonwealth sought to challenge on the basis of the fraud exception. Subsequently, AWB made it clear that this concession did not extend to six documents relating to the iron filings rebate payment. During the course of the hearing in this Court, AWB produced an unmasked copy of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 and provided it to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth tendered the memorandum as an exhibit in this proceeding, without any objection from AWB. The memorandum contains a fairly full description of the way in which AWB planned to pay the iron filings claim to GBI. The memorandum, which was sent by Whitwell to Messrs Geary and Long, with copies to Scales, Johnson, Hogan, Johnstone, Cooper, Lyons, Hockey and Thomas, states: ' PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL This memo is in respect to refunding the Grain Board of Iraq the quality rebate of approx USD 2,016,133 through the inland transport payments for the new contract as requested by the Minister of Trade, Iraq. In addition, for the record IS &amp; M has negotiated (through an uplift in price] the recovery of a USD 8.375 million outstanding debt to Tigris by IGB through this contract. AWB will repay this debt back to Tigris less an agreed recovery fee of USD 500 K on a pro rata basis as tonnage is shipped. Overview Delegation led by Andrew Lindberg (August 2002) to Baghdad agreed to settle the contamination of the 'Iron Filings' vessels by paying them USD 6 pmt for each vessel total = USD 2,016,133 After being approached by Tigris Petroleum AWB and IGB have agreed to allow the new contract to be the conduit for a repayment of USD 8,375,000 owed to Tigris by IGB for a cargo of wheat shipped in 1996. IGB have agreed to raising the contract price by the debt amount and when payments are made under the Letter of Credit AWB will pay Tigris its debt less AWBs recovery fee. We have suggested the following during our last two visits. &#8226; Offsetting the debt against the Outstanding debt to 'Tigris petroleum' (approx USD 8.35 million) &#8226; Reducing the any new contract price [sic] by the amount of the rebate on a pmt basis &#8226; Repaying the debt through the provision of aid in some form - Wheat, Health supplies etc. However, in discussion with the Minister of Trade he has continually , insisted on repayment directly as an addition to the inland transport and said that this was his understanding of the agreement with Andrew Lindberg - Michael Long was present and confirms that this was discussed. Now that the new contract has been concluded ISM need a sign off to organise this payment when shipments start. Issues &#8226; Possible implications for AWB on a corporate governance basis ie/ direct payment to a company with links to the Iraqi regime may be construed to be in contravention of the UN Sanctions. The relevant UN Security Council Resolution is 661 (1990). This resolution provides at clause 4: ""...All States shall not make available to the Government of Iraq or to any commercial, industrial or public utility undertaking in Iraq any funds or any other financial or economic resources and shall prevent their nationals and any persons within their territories from removing from their territories or otherwise making available to that Government or to any such undertaking any such funds or resources and from remitting any other funds to persons or bodies within Iraq.... except payments exclusively for strictly medical or humanitarian purposes and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs."" In summary, this means that the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia would be obliged to prevent AWB Limited from making any remittance of funds to the IGB. AWB Legal opinion in this regard is set out below. This does not mean, however, that a payment might not be able to be made which will comply with the terms of the UN Resolutions. As a minimum, if AWB management determines to make the payment, then it should be made in the following circumstances: 1. The payment is made in installments over time and coincides with payments for future shipments of wheat (ie not a lump sum payment); 2. The payments preferably be made to a company other than the IGB and in a jurisdiction other than Iraq; and 3. The payments be recorded as being made as a part of a settlement reached between AWB and IGB, the terms of which contemplated that IGB would agree not to take any action against AWB for the alleged contamination of the 8 vessels in 2002 with iron filings AND would agree to enter into contracts for the purchase of Australian bulk wheat in the future in exchange for a renegotiation of the price on the 8 vessels. If we ensure that the above requirements are met, then Legal consider it will be at least arguable that we are not 'making funds or financial resources available to the Iraqi Government'. Instead, we are repaying part of the contract price for the 8 vessels following a re-negotiation of the sale price due to a downgrading of the grain (which potentially contained iron filings). In addition to the above the UN Security Council resolutions also require (resolution 986 (1995) clause 8) that the cost of food exports to Iraq must be met by draw down from the UN ""escrow account"". Furthermore draw down from the escrow account is only allowable under strict conditions. Those conditions include, at clause 8(a)(iii) that the goods to which payment is referable shall have arrived in Iraq. In this case, the goods have already arrived in Iraq and HAVE been paid for in full. However, the Resolutions are SILENT on the procedure for any repayment of part of the price in circumstances where there has been a quality complaint (and a subsequent renegotiation of price). This may therefore give us more scope to make the repayment to IGB. Even if we make payment as outlined above, there is still a risk that the Australian Government and/or the United Nations will take a contrary view on the interpretation of the above mentioned resolutions and declare that AWB has breached the terms of those resolutions by making the payment. This is a commercial and political issue, which AWB's management will need to consider. &#8226; According to an informal discussion with DFAT any repayment of a quality rebate should be either re-payed through UN ESCROW account or as a contract price reduction however they have not had a full legal argument put in front of them or been told officially. In Public affairs opinion as long as the repayment is legal and could not be seen to be breaking UN Sanctions then we should proceed (with the proviso that we have an independent legal opinion to that effect - see above legal opinion). Public Affairs also expressed concern that this would not be well received by the UN OIP office and that there was a reasonable chance of them finding out. IS &amp; M on the other hand do not want them involved and feel confident that this issue could be handled without the need for the OIP to be consulted. It has been articulated to us and we have circumstantial evidence that other participants in the OIP program (Russian and Pakistani companies) have had to sort out quality problems in a similar way and it is unlikely either their national governments or the OIP were consulted &#8226; IS &amp; M feel strongly that a failure to repay the IGB as discussed will lead to serious consequences for AWBs relationship with the IGB. IS &amp; M also believe that failure to refund this agreed debt in this way would have serious implications for the execution of the new contracts. AWBI are aware of all the issues laid out above and in light of the commercial imperative of this situation agree with the recommendation as laid out below. They do however insist that the Managing Director is appraised of the situation. Actions Whilst IS &amp; M have received a number of different opinions from different areas of AWB and an informal opinion from DFAT we still feel this issue is a grey area with no prescriptive answers. Based on the opinions we do have and the commercial circumstances surrounding this issue IS &amp; M recommend and seek approval for the following: &#8226; IS &amp; M is to repay debt as per method outlined in AWBs legal opinion (and requested by the Minister of Trade) directly to Alia Transport in Jordan in instalments. IS &amp; M will also look to obtain written agreement from IGB to the payment in the format agreed by legal however it is not guaranteed. &#8226; Managing Director only to convey our intentions to the Australian Government at the appropriate time prior to Shipment. The timing of such a disclosure is important and we would recommend that nothing be done until at least Letters of Credit are in place for these contracts. Given that this is unlikely to happen until after a war with Iraq it may allow us a further chance of renegotiation with a new regime. &#8226; IS &amp; M to finalise as soon as possible a written agreement with Tigris with regard to the settlement of their debt.' [Original emphasis omitted] The evidence before me establishes to the requisite prima facie standard that the price in contracts A1670 and A1680 was inflated to cover both the amount of the iron filings claim and the repayment by GBI of the debt which it owed to Tigris. A surcharge of US$8.375 pmt was added to each contract in respect of the Tigris debt, as shown by an email from Nigel Edmonds-Wilson to Scales and others at AWB dated 12 December 2002. The same email shows that in each contract the inland transportation fee was set at US$51.15 pmt. At the Commission, Mr Geary of AWB gave evidence that the prices in these two contracts were inflated to cover a component for the Tigris debt and a component for the US$2 million iron filings rebate. He also said that the United Nations was not advised at any stage that the prices for wheat in these two contracts had been inflated in this way so as to cover the Tigris debt and the iron filings claim. To adopt the words of Viscount Finlay in O'Rourke , the evidence gives ample 'colour to the charge' that the prices in these two contracts were falsely misrepresented. The evidence shows that the prices in the two wheat contracts were inflated as a means of extracting money from the United Nations' escrow account. Having regard to the terms of the memorandum of 7 February 2003, there are reasonable grounds for believing that, having extracted approximately US$2 million from the escrow account to meet the iron filings claim, AWB planned to pay that money in instalments to GBI via the mechanism of inland transportation fees. The material before me, including Whitwell's email of 7 November 2002 and his memorandum of 7 February 2003, indicates clearly that AWB knew that paying inland transportation fees to Alia was a means of making payments to the Iraqi Government. This plan was concealed from the United Nations. The planned payments of the iron filings claim were never carried into effect because the invasion of Iraq intervened. Scales gave evidence to the Commission that the iron filings money has never been paid and remains in AWBI's accounts. However, the fact that the payments were never made to the GBI will not prevent the application of the fraud exception so long as there is sufficient evidence that the communications were in furtherance of, or preparatory to, the commission of the fraud or impropriety in the broad sense described above: see Butler; and Clements at 562 [213]. In my view, the evidence establishes a more than adequate prima facie case that AWB knowingly and deliberately disguised the true nature of the prices in contracts A1670 and A1680. If it be relevant, I also consider that the evidence establishes the foregoing matters on the balance of probabilities and to a level of satisfaction commensurate with the seriousness of the allegation: see Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 at 362 per Dixon J. No question arises here of evidence which would not be admissible in a final hearing: cf Propend . AWB argued that there was no evidence that the transaction furthered any particular fraud, iniquity or illegality. It submitted that it is common ground that the United Nations' resolutions were not in terms incorporated into Australian law. AWB submitted that, consequently, the fraud exception is not available to take the documents out of the operation of the doctrine of legal professional privilege. This narrow approach is at odds with the authorities that stress the wide range of fraudulent or iniquitous activities that fall within the principle. I have inspected the six documents that were said to relate to the iron filings claim. My inspection of AWB's documents revealed a further four documents that fall within this category and are still the subject of a privilege claim. I am satisfied that these 10 documents are not privileged. The documents were, prima facie, brought into existence in furtherance of an improper and dishonest purpose, viz inflating the prices of contracts A1670 and A1680 so as to extract payments out of the United Nations' escrow account that would then be utilised, in part, to satisfy a compensation claim by GBI. Prima facie, the evidence establishes that the transaction was deliberately and dishonestly structured by AWB so as to misrepresent the true nature and purpose of the trucking fees and to work a trickery on the United Nations. It would be contrary to public policy for the privilege to enure in communications of this kind. The 10 documents in question are listed below in my conclusions. There is an alternative basis for rejecting AWB's claim for privilege over the 10 iron filings documents. AWB's disclosure of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 and its tender by the Commonwealth as an exhibit in these proceedings, without any objection or claim to confidentiality by AWB, effects a waiver over the subject matter of the legal advice set out in the memorandum. My inspection of the 10 documents relating to the iron filings claim confirms my view that those documents relate to the subjects and issues that are canvassed in the memorandum of 7 February 2003. If, contrary to my view, any privilege subsisted in any of the documents, it has been waived by AWB. When the Commonwealth tendered the unmasked version of the memorandum of 7 February 2003, I asked Mr Judd why AWB's production of that document did not waive any privilege that subsisted in documents relating to the iron filings claim. Mr Judd's response was that the Commonwealth did not put its case on that basis. I do not think that is entirely correct. In the particulars of its case, the Commonwealth contended that AWB's disclosure of the masked version of the memorandum of 7 February 2003 worked a waiver of any privilege in documents relating to Project Water and the Tigris transaction. The Commonwealth has never varied from the position that the iron filings claim was an integral part of the Tigris transaction. However, the Commonwealth did not in its closing address make any submission that privilege over the six documents had been waived by the production of the unmasked memorandum. To that extent, Mr Judd's response was correct. Despite these matters, I have concluded that the Court cannot ignore the effect of the evidence before it, especially as AWB is seeking a declaration that the 10 documents are privileged. CONCLUSIONS It is not feasible in these reasons for judgment, when so many documents are at issue, to set out separate reasons for the decision I have reached on each particular document. I have reached the conclusions set forth hereunder after inspecting all of the documents in AWB's revised list of privileged documents and by applying the legal principles and factual findings identified above. AWB has not made out its claim for privilege in respect of the following documents: 229, 245-247, 279, 280, 362B, 469A, 495, 542, 565, 586, 675, 784, 867, 872, 890AN, 1090, 1091, 1095, 1096, 1098, 1099, 1118 and 1262. These documents fall into the following categories : (a) documents for which there is no evidence of purpose to satisfy the dominant purpose test (documents 229, 469A, 542 and 565); (b) documents where the evidence does not satisfy the dominant purpose test, having regard to the nature and content of the document and the vague and formulaic evidence contained in the relevant segments of the affidavit evidence (documents 279, 280, 495, 675, 784, 867, 872, 890AN, 1095, 1096, 1098, 1099, 1118 and 1262); (c) a document that was provided to a third party and therefore was not a confidential communication for the dominant purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice (document 362B); (d) documents which are partly not proven and partly waived (documents 245-247, 586, 1090, 1091 which are discussed further below). If, contrary to my view, privilege does attach to any of these documents, there has been a waiver of privilege in respect of all of them, other than documents 362B, 784, 872 and 1118. The waived documents are included in the list at [237] below. In addition, there are 10 documents relating to the iron filings claims. They are as follows: 30, 31, 32, 32A, 33, 41, 594, 595, 595A and 596. Privilege does not attach to these documents as they were brought into existence in furtherance of a fraud or other impropriety. Alternatively, any privilege has been waived by AWB. These documents are included in the list at [237] below. AWB has waived any legal professional privilege that subsisted in the following documents: 12, 301-33, 41, 56, 77-79, 81-85, 100-106, 110-117, 120-124, 126, 127, 129-132, 136, 137, 139, 140, 161, 213, 229, 235, 240, 241, 245-247, 250, 252, 253, 257-259, 263, 265-268, 271, 279, 280, 283, 284, 290, 292, 294-301, 308-310, 313, 326, 327, 330-333, 335A-342, 344, 348, 353A, 355-357, 359, 361, 362A, 365, 375, 377-380, 385, 386, 394, 422, 423, 424, 425, 432, 443, 445-449, 455, 461, 463, 465, 469A, 486, 487, 495, 507, 508, 513, 523, 524, 533, 534, 541-544, 547, 548, 553-555, 557, 563, 565, 568-579, 582-590, 592, 594-596, 599, 601-603, 675, 681, 681A, 689A, 689B, 699-704D, 704J-704P, 704T, 704X, 704AA, 704FF, 704KK, 711-715, 721, 722, 725, 729-733, 736-739, 749, 753, 755-757, 762, 771, 788, 794, 798, 815, 817, 820, 823, 824, 837, 840, 847, 867, 890AA, 890AD, 890AE, 890AH, 890AI, 890AJ, 890AK, 890AM, 890AN, 890AP, 890AQ, 1005, 1006, 1009, 1011-1013, 1025, 1026, 1028-1030, 1032, 1033, 1051, 1056, 1059, 1070, 1088-1096, 1098, 1099, 1119- 1121, 1123, 1124, 1144-1152, 1161-1163, 1183-1187, 1221, 1222, 1262 and 1297. In broad terms, the documents over which privilege has been waived comprise documents falling within the following categories: documents which define the scope of AWB's internal review or which identify what investigations were carried out; summaries, chronologies and other documents which record or analyse the results of those investigations; witness statements and other notes or records of interviews of AWB personnel; records of meetings and periodical reports concerning the findings of the review; and documents seeking advice, or comprising or recording advice provided to AWB, as to whether AWB or any of its employees engaged in wrongdoing in connection with wheat sales to Iraq under the OFF Programme, including any wrongdoing in connection with the Tigris transaction. As I have explained, waiver does not turn on whether the documents attracted the description 'Project Rose' or 'Project Water'. On inspection, I determined that numerous documents marked 'Re: Project Rose' or the equivalent fall outside the scope of any waiver as they related to distinct matters about which AWB sought or obtained legal advice, such as the powers and jurisdiction of the PSI and IIC investigators, other US legal issues, the memorandum of understanding between the IIC and AWB, representation of AWB employees at IIC hearings, the powers of the Wheat Export Authority, and issues of directors' and officers' insurance and corporate governance. There are a number of documents where, on inspection, I have determined that the document is only capable of attracting privilege as to part (the balance of the claim for privilege not having been proved), but that such privilege has been waived. These documents require some further explanation: (a) Documents 245 and 246 are drafts of an information paper dated 13 August 2004. Document 247 substantially replicates the draft information paper in a power point presentation format. AWB claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents, as indicated on the face of the documents. In substance, AWB contended that these parts attracted privilege because they recorded legal advice. On inspection I concluded that the claim is not established in respect of the first part of the documents. I have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but AWB has waived privilege in respect of that second part. (b) Document 586 is a table of various legal advices in the possession of Blakes. AWB contended that the table recorded legal advice. On inspection I concluded that this claim is not sustainable , save for the entries listed at 23, 24 and 25 of the table which disclose the substance of legal advice given by Mr Tracey QC. I have determined that AWB has waived privilege in respect of entries 23, 24 and 25 of the table. (c) Documents 1090 and 1091 are, respectively, the minutes of AWB and AWBI board meetings dated 22 February 2005. AWB claims privilege in two parts of each of these documents, as indicated on the face of the documents. It contended that these parts recorded legal advice. As to the first part claimed, this is not borne out by my inspection. I have determined that the second part claimed attracts privilege but AWB has waived privilege in respect of that second part. There are also a number of documents which I have determined to be privileged only as to part of the claim made by AWB. After inspecting the documents and applying the principles I have discussed, I have determined that certain parts of the documents are privileged, while privilege in another part or parts of the documents has not been proved or it has been waived. It is necessary to deal with each of these documents: (a) Document 138 contains three pages of handwritten file notes. Privilege has not been established in respect of the first page of the document. If (contrary to my view) privilege is attracted, it has been waived. Privilege is established in respect of the second page of the document. Privilege has not been established in respect of the third page of the document; or if privilege is attracted, contrary to my view, it has been waived. (b) Document 251 is a document consisting of a number of entries in a spreadsheet. AWB claims privilege in certain parts of the document, as indicated on the face of the document. AWB has waived privilege in respect of the parts claimed on pages 367, 368, 380, 390, and the first of the two parts claimed on each of pages 388 and 395. The page numbering refers to the system that AWB has adopted for its document control purposes. Otherwise, the document attracts privilege to the extent claimed. (c) Document 376 is a handwritten file note headed 'Iraq Report for JIS'. I have determined that the document attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document that relates to the Tigris transaction, namely the second entry commencing with the words 'completion of Iraq mkt. access arrangements' and concluding with the words 'confirm there is compliance'. (d) Documents 503, 520, 522, 526, 527 and 965 contain various drafts of a briefing paper initially prepared by ABL. I have determined that each of the documents attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of each document under the headings 'Legal Review' and 'Key Messages'. (e) Document 516 is another draft of the briefing paper referred to in the preceding subparagraph. I have determined that the document attracts privilege, but that AWB has waived privilege in respect of the part of the document under the heading 'Legal Review'. (f) Document 691 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal AWB employees and external lawyers. AWB said that the document attracted privilege in part. Dr Fuller gave evidence that it recorded legal advice of Leonie Thompson. I have determined that the passage on page 028 of the document opposite the entry 'Leonie T' is privileged. As to the remainder of the document, it does not record any legal advice and is not privileged. (g) Document 696 is a record of a meeting attended by various internal AWB employees and external lawyers. AWB claimed that the document was part privileged, and relied on Dr Fuller's evidence that it recorded legal advice given by Leon Zwier. I have determined that the passage on page 037 of the document opposite the heading 'Leon Zwier' (to the balance of the page) is privileged. Privilege has not been established in respect of the remainder of the document. If any privilege attached to the remainder, it has been waived. (h) Document 704S is a record of various matters discussed between AWB's external and internal lawyers. I have determined that AWB has waived privilege over the six lines commencing with the entry which includes the words 'iron filings case'. The balance of the document is privileged. (i) Document 704II is a handwritten record of various conversations on 20 and 28 September 2004. On the face of the document, it appears that a claim for privilege is made only over the part of the document which is dated 28 September 2004. Privilege has been established over the entry dated 28 September 2004. However the evidence of Ms Peavey in relation to document 704II addresses the entry of 20 September 2004. If privilege is claimed over the part of the document which is dated 20 September 2004, it has not been established. (j) Document 1097 is the minutes of a meeting of the AWB and AWBI joint board committee. There are two parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made on the ground that they record legal advice. On inspection I determined that the part of the document consisting of the first bullet point under the heading 'Project Rose' is privileged. However, privilege has not been established over the third bullet point. If privilege is attracted over that part of the document, it has been waived. Document 1297 is a redacted copy of an email from Cooper to Lindberg and Scales, copied to Quennell, dated 16 November 2004. It appears that the redactions mask those parts of the document over which a claim for privilege is made. Prima facie, the document appears to be within the scope of the waiver I have identified and applied in these reasons for judgment. However, I propose to invite further submissions from the parties as to whether document 1297 is in contest and, if so, I will direct that an unredacted version of the document be filed with the Court for its inspection. As for the remaining documents, AWB has in some instances claimed privilege over the entire document and in other instances it has only claimed privilege over a designated part or parts of the document. AWB has established that legal professional privilege attaches to the following documents to the extent claimed by it: 20, 21, 55, 89-98, 107, 108, 119, 133, 135, 143-146, 150-152, 154-160, 162-190, 194, 196, 197, 199-201, 204-211A, 215, 217-222, 224-228, 230-234, 237-239, 254-256, 260-262, 264, 269, 270, 273-278, 281, 282, 285, 286, 288, 293, 302-306, 311, 315-324, 334, 343, 345-347, 349-353, 354, 358, 362, 368, 374, 381, 382, 384, 387, 388-393, 395, 398-408, 410, 412-414, 416-421, 423A, 426-428, 430, 431, 433-442, 444, 450-454, 456, 457, 459, 460, 462, 464, 465A, 467, 468, 470-473, 475-485, 488, 490-494, 496-502, 504-506, 509, 510, 514, 515, 517-519, 521, 525, 529, 530, 536-540, 549-552, 556, 558-562, 564, 566, 567, 581, 591, 593, 600, 605, 671, 672, 673A, 679, 694, 696A, 704E 704I, 704Q, 704R, 704U-704W, 704Y, 704Z, 704BB-704EE, 704GG, 704HH, 704JJ, 706-710, 724, 727, 740-745, 747, 748, 751, 752, 754, 758-761, 763-766, 768-770, 772, 773, 775, 777, 779-781, 785, 787, 790, 792, 797, 799-802A, 804, 806-814, 816, 818, 819, 821, 822, 826-831, 835, 849-852, 856, 857, 860, 861, 863, 865, 866, 868-870, 873, 876, 877, 879, 881-883, 885, 887-889, 890AB, 890AC, 890AG, 890AIA, 890AL, 890AR-AZ, 890BA-890BG, 937AJ, 937AP, 942, 947, 948, 950-953, 956-964, 966, 970-992, 994, 995, 997, 998, 1000-1004, 1071, 1073-1081, 1082A, 1083, 1086, 1087, 1112-1113A, 1114-1117, 1118A, 1152A, 1155, 1158-1160, 1190, 1195, 1196, 1200, 1206, 1213-1215, 1218, 1225, 1226, 1229, 1231, 1232, 1234, 1237, 1239, 1240, 1243, 1246-1250, 1252, 1255, 1256, 1260, 1261, 1293 and 1299-1301. COPY DOCUMENTS AWB has filed a list of duplicate privileged documents. The list is Exhibit JM5 to the affidavit of John Mitchell sworn 28 July 2002. Each document in the list is a duplicate of an identified document in AWB's list of privileged documents. The duplicates fill 17 lever arch folders. AWB has sought a declaration that the documents in this list are, or record, confidential communications that are protected from production to the Commissioner by legal professional privilege. At the hearing, neither AWB nor the Commonwealth directed any substantive submissions to the status of these duplicate documents. In its written submissions, AWB referred to the principles enunciated in Propend as to the circumstances in which a copy of an unprivileged document can itself attract legal professional privilege. In those written submissions, AWB contended that the qualification which Brennan CJ expressed in Propend at 512 does not represent the law. The Chief Justice's qualification was that if the original unprivileged document is not in existence or its location is not disclosed or it is not produced, and if no unprivileged copy or other admissible evidence is available to prove the contents of the original document, then privilege cannot be maintained over the copy. However, AWB did not make any submissions as to how, or why, this qualification might be relevant to its claims. AWB adopted the position that the status of the duplicate documents depends on my decision as to the status of the corresponding original document. The Commonwealth did not make any submission to the contrary at the hearing, although its written submissions contended that AWB had failed to identify the purpose for which particular duplicates were created, or to establish that they were kept confidential. It would seem a harsh result if AWB were to lose the benefit of privilege in original documents simply because it has not explained or is unable to explain the circumstances in which copies were made. In large organisations and within law firms, it is hardly unexpected that multiple copies of privileged documents will be brought into existence and that, long after the event, it may be difficult to adduce evidence as to the circumstances in which the copies were made. The submissions of the parties were so cursory that I did not gain any meaningful assistance from them. However, I have reached the following conclusions. Where I have held that specified original documents do not attract legal professional privilege, no case has been made out that duplicates of those documents are entitled to privilege. Where I have held that specified original documents attract legal professional privilege, I have concluded that privilege attaches to the duplicates. The duplicates come from the custody of AWB, and there is nothing to suggest that the duplicates were dealt with, or communicated, in ways that would deny the privilege claim. Furthermore, the material before me does not identify any specific grounds for concluding that the duplicates do not attract privilege. A number of documents in AWB's revised list of privileged documents are said to be duplicates of other documents in the list. There is no evidence as to some of those documents (documents 291, 307 and 580) and others have been removed (documents 26 and 1031). Consequently, I have not made any findings about those documents; it is unclear whether they remain in contest. It is necessary to make specific reference to a number of other duplicate documents in the list: (a) Document 582 is a copy of document 140. I have determined that AWB has waived any privilege attaching to the documents. (b) Document 998 is a copy of document 995 and document 1001 is a copy of part of document 1000. I have determined that the originals are privileged. For the reasons given at [247] above, privilege attaches to the copy documents. (c) Document 1006 is said by Chesterman to be a copy of document 1005. My inspection of the documents has revealed that this is not the case. There is therefore no evidence capable of supporting the claim for privilege in respect of document 1006. However, even if there were evidence that document 1006 attracted privilege, I am satisfied that AWB has waived the privilege. RELIEF I have determined that specified documents are not the subject of legal professional privilege and that other documents attract legal professional privilege. The Court has power to make declarations to this effect. I propose to give AWB and the Commonwealth an opportunity to make submissions as to the form of any declarations that should be made to give effect to these reasons for judgment. AWB's second further amended application also sought declarations relating to the construction and validity of the Amending Act. In addition, AWB sought a declaration that the exercise of powers by the Commissioner under s 6AA(2) of the RCA, while these proceedings are pending before this Court, would constitute a contempt of Court, and injunctions restraining the Commissioner from making a decision under s 6AA(2) of the RCA. No live issues arise concerning these claims for relief: see AWB Ltd v Honourable Terence Rhoderic Hudson Cole (No 2) [2006] FCA 913. Neither AWB nor the Commonwealth put any submissions to me, whether orally or in writing, concerning these claims for relief. It is unnecessary to address them further. Accordingly, the only orders I propose to make at this stage are as follows: (1) Within 3 business days AWB and the Commonwealth file an agreed minute of orders that give effect to these reasons for judgment. If AWB and the Commonwealth are unable to agree upon appropriate orders, within 3 business days AWB and the Commonwealth shall each file and serve a minute of the orders that it contends are necessary and appropriate to give effect to these reasons for judgment. (2) The proceeding be adjourned to Monday 25 September 2006 at 10.15am for any argument as to the orders. I certify that the preceding two hundred and fifty-one (251) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Young.

Case20801,cited,Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557,"The principles governing the exercise of the Court's power to summarily dismiss a claim on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, the principles which govern pleadings in this Court and the relevant authorities are conveniently summarised by Weinberg J in McKellar v Container Terminal Management Services Ltd [1999] FCA 1101 ; (1999) 165 ALR 409 at 415-421. It is not necessary to restate, at length, his Honour's exposition of the relevant rules and the statements of principle which emerge from the cases to which he refers. It is sufficient, for present purposes, to note that: &#8226; The power to dismiss a claim because it discloses no reasonable cause of action will not lightly be exercised: see Dey v Victorian Railways Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 at 91; General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways (NSW) [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 at 128-130; Webster v Lampard [1993] HCA 57 ; (1993) 177 CLR 598 at 602-603. &#8226; The purpose of pleadings is to define the issues with sufficient clarity such that respondents understand, and have the opportunity to meet, the case made against them: see Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70 ; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at 664; Mitanis v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd [1997] ATPR 41-591 at 44, 151ff. &#8226; A statement of claim must plead all the material facts necessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action. If it does not it is liable to be struck out: Mitanis ; Bruce v Odhams Press Ltd [1936] 1 KB 697 at 712-713. &#8226; It is not sufficient for the pleader to state conclusions drawn from unstated facts: see Trade Practices Commission v David Jones (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] FCA 228 ; (1985) 7 FCR 109 at 114-5. &#8226; There will be cases in which the power to strike out pleadings will not be exercised notwithstanding a failure to plead all material facts. Such restraint will be appropriate where the deficiency causes no confusion and does not raise issues of substantive principle ( HECEC Australia Pty Ltd v Hydro-Electric Corp [1999] FCA 822 at [59] ), and where deficiencies can be overcome by ordering the provision of particulars or the furnishing of affidavits ( State of Queensland v Pioneer Concrete (Qld) Pty Ltd [1999] ATPR 41-691 at 42,828-9). &#8226; Not all conclusionary pleadings will be struck out as being deficient: see Charlie Carter Pty Ltd v The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association (WA) (1987) 13 FCR 413 at 417. Whether or not such a pleading should be struck out will depend on whether or not the facts are pleaded at too great a level of generality: see Kernel Holdings Pty Ltd v Rothmans of Pall Mall (Australia) Pty Ltd [1991] FCA 557. 32 Section 33H of the FCA Act requires that any application commencing a representative proceeding must identify the group members to whom the proceeding relates, specify the nature of the claims made on behalf of the group and specify the questions of law or fact common to the claims of the group members. By s 33C of the Act it is required that seven or more persons have claims against the same respondent, that the claims arise out of the same or similar or related circumstances and that the claims of all group members give rise to a substantial common issue of law or fact. 33 As defined, the group in the present proceeding includes persons who have dealt directly with one or more of the respondents in relation to the provision of international airfreight services. It also includes persons who have had no such direct dealing but who have ""paid"" more than $20,000 for such services during the relevant period. The pleadings in paragraphs 85 and 86 suggest that, within the defined group, there are two further sub-groups: those members who have both paid for and acquired international airfreight services and those who have merely paid for those services. As will be seen these are not mere semantic objections. They give rise to the potential for confusion and, in turn, to embarrassment and prejudice. 34 Before turning to the substantial difficulties to which the imprecision of the definition of the group gives rise, it is to be observed that there are insufficient material facts pleaded to establish that the applicant is a member of the defined group which it seeks to represent. No attempt is made to establish (other than by conclusionary statement in paragraph 85) that the applicant acquired or paid for any international airfreight services in Australia (or anywhere else) during the relevant period. When read together, ss 33C and 33H of the FCA Act require that an applicant in a representative proceeding must be a person who shares with group members the same identifying criteria. 45 The fuel surcharge is dealt with in paragraphs 29 to 55 of the SASC. In paragraph 54 it is pleaded that ""[t]he Respondents and each of them engaged in the conduct alleged in paragraph (sic) 31-51 ..."" In paragraph 55 it is alleged that, by doing so, the respondents and each of them gave effect to the global cartel arrangement or the subsidiary fuel surcharge arrangement. In paragraph 87(b) it is alleged that all respondents are jointly and severally liable for all loss and damage caused by the imposition of the fuel surcharge. 46 When, however, one examines paragraphs 31 to 51 one finds that paragraphs 31 to 36 deal exclusively with the conduct of Lufthansa; paragraphs 41-45 deal exclusively with the conduct of British Airways, and paragraphs 46-50 deal exclusively with the conduct of Japan Airlines. In paragraph 37 it is alleged that all respondents, other than Lufthansa, introduced fuel surcharges ""at agreed levels"" in February 2000. No particulars of this agreement are provided, nor are the ""agreed levels"" identified. 47 The war-risk surcharge is dealt with in paragraphs 64 to 70 of the SASC. The parties to the arrangement pursuant to which the war-risk surcharge was imposed are identified in each of these paragraphs as being Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and British Airways. It is not pleaded that Qantas, Cathay Pacific, Air New Zealand or Japan Airlines were party to the arrangement or gave effect to it. 48 Despite this paragraph 87(d) pleads that all respondents are jointly and severally liable for all loss and damage caused by the imposition of the war-risk surcharge arrangement. 49 The applicant seeks to meet the respondents' objections to these parts of the SASC by contending that all respondents are liable for any damages occasioned by the imposition of any surcharge because they were all parties to the ""overarching"" global cartel arrangement. That overarching arrangement is said, in paragraph 26, to be an agreement to meet and discuss the fixing of prices for the carriage of international airfreight and to conceal any resulting price-fixing arrangements. The surcharges are said to have been agreed upon in the course of meetings and discussions held under the overarching arrangement. This arrangement contemplated that any agreed fixing of prices would emerge from further discussions among the respondents or some of them. In the case of the war-risk surcharge not all respondents are alleged to have agreed to impose the surcharge or to have given effect to such an agreement. Their participation in the making of the global cartel arrangement, without more, cannot render those respondents which were not involved in the making and implementing of the war-risk surcharge agreement jointly and severally liable for damages arising from the imposition of that surcharge. 50 These parts of the SASC are internally inconsistent, confusing and embarrassing."
Case8592,cited,Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709,"In light of the above cases, and putting to one side the effect if any of the communications between Mr Myer and Mr Patching, there would be no arguable basis at all for any contention that AFP officers had a legal responsibility to warn any of the applicants either that they were under police surveillance or that they were exposing themselves to the foreseeable risk of the death penalty especially given the information acquired about the applicants in the ongoing AFP investigation. Having been prepared for whatever reason to engage in criminal activity, the applicants would properly be regarded as the authors of their own harm: cf Emanuele v Hedley [1998] FCA 709 esp in its reliance on State Rail Authority of New South Wales v Wiegold (1991) 25 NSWLR 500 at 517. And the police would have been entitled to have treated them as no more than subjects of an ongoing criminal investigation which fell clearly within the mandated functions of the AFP. Given the police's function in the matter, the applicants would not have been objects of rescue (as they would have been if there was a duty to warn)."
Case25192,cited,Buckley v Bennell Design &amp; Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301,"Those cases reflect the policy underlying s 1335 that security may be ordered where a company appears to be in no position to provide security from its own resources where, in all the circumstances, it is reasonable that the resources of some other person or entity standing behind the company or of some person or entity for whose practical benefit the proceeding is being conducted should provide the security. The privilege of limited liability should not necessarily exclude those standing to benefit from proceedings by that company from having to provide support to it: Buckley v Bennell Design &amp; Constructions Pty Ltd (1974) 1 ACLR 301 at 303-304. The approach was conveniently expressed in Bell Wholesale 2 FCR 1 at 4 where the Full Court (Sheppard, Morling and Neaves JJ) said: ""In our opinion a court is not justified in declining to order security on the ground that to do so will frustrate the litigation unless a company in the position of the applicant here establishes that those who stand behind it and who will benefit from the litigation if it is successful (whether they be shareholders or creditors or, as in this case, beneficiaries under a trust) are also without means."""

This further issue was raised by Mr Rhodes by way of challenge to the exercise by AFMA of its power of cancellation of Mr Rhodes' fishing permit for reasons of so-called 'non-payment of fees or levies'; it was acknowledged that '[i]n determining the scope of the obligation of natural justice, the statutory framework is of crucial importance'. I was referred by Mr Rhodes to the High Court decision of Mobil Oil Australia Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1963] HCA 41 ; (1963) 113 CLR 475, where in the reasons for judgment of Kitto J at 502-4, his Honour considered whether the Taxation Board of Review was '... legally bound to conform to the principles of natural justice in dealing with a reference in a case under s 136' . Kitto J made the prefatory observations that '[a] legal obligation so to act arises in respect of many statutory powers...', there being '... no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of tribunal...', but '[w]hat the law requires in the discharge of a quasi-judicial function is judicial fairness' , which is '... not a label for any fixed body of rules...,' and '[w]hat is fair in a given situation depends upon the circumstances' . The statutory context of the then Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1958 (Cth), which was of course in focus in Mobil Oil , is significantly removed from that of the Management Act. Mr Rhodes sought support additionally for the operation in principle of the rules as to natural justice from the dictum of Brennan J in National Companies and Securities Commission v News Corporation Ltd [1984] HCA 29 ; (1984) 156 CLR 296 at 326, where his Honour observed as follows: the limits of a statutory function are ascertained the interests which are apt to be affected by the performance of the function can be identified. Then it is possible for a court to say in the absence of express statutory provision what has to be done to be fair to those whose interests are apt to be affected by the performance of the function. The terms of the statute which creates the function, the nature of the function and the administrative framework in which the statute requires the function to be performed are material factors in determining what must be done to satisfy the requirements of natural justice....' Those considerations render formidable the task of establishing the operation of the rules of natural justice in the present statutory context where the basis for prospective qualification would be the same for all applicants, that being the holding of an existing shark permit conditional of course upon payment of the permit fee or levy."

The first respondent submitted that an implied term of good faith was neither reasonable nor necessary in this case. It submitted that the mechanism established by the lease, allowing the lessor to nominate the rental assessment and the lessee to object, contemplates that the rent specified in the lessor's rental assessment may not be reasonable, or otherwise acceptable to the lessee. The first respondent submitted that the presence of the objection mechanism demonstrates that no such implied term is necessary. 94 The first respondent contended that the implication of such a term would alter the effect of the rent review mechanism agreed to, as it would enable a lessee to ignore a notice and ""embark upon a curial challenge"". 95 Even if such a term were to be implied, the first respondent submitted that the content of that term would require nothing more of the first respondent than that the rental assessment contained in the notice be an honestly held opinion. The first respondent submitted that the evidence supports the contention that the assessment contained in the notice represented the honest opinion of Mr Allen."
Case21850,cited,Moodemere Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Waters [1998] VR 215,"The general entitlement of a receiver appointed under a charge to deduct and retain, out of the funds realised, costs, charges and expense incurred in the realisation was asserted as a matter of general principle in Moodemere Pty Ltd (In Liq) v Waters [1998] VR 215 at 222 (Murphy J) and 229 (Tadgell J). In Nicobar Pty Ltd v Abrokiss (2003) 48 ACSR 259, Young CJ said (at [60]): 'The general rule is that where a person who is a fiduciary or an officer of the court produces a fund through his own effort, he is entitled to an equitable lien over the fund in respect of defending himself against claims made against him for what he did in producing the fund.' His Honour, however, was not prepared to accept that an equitable lien might exist in the case of a privately appointed receiver, saying (at [62]): 'Although the scope of equitable liens is wide and the boundaries are flexible, and although a receiver appointed out of court owes fiduciary duties both to his appointor and perhaps also to the mortgagor, I do not consider that the principle applies to receivers appointed out of court. If this were not so, there would be little point in the authorities continuing to emphasise the fact that the receivers in the successful cases of lien were receivers appointed by the court.' His Honour referred to O'Donnell, Company Receivers &amp; Administrators at [12.109] (Update 40) and Harris &amp; Lewin Pty Ltd (in liq) v Harris &amp; Lewin Agents Pty Ltd (1975-76) CLC 40-216.

The applicant does not have to make out a prima facie case: Quanta Software at ALR 541-2 [24]; IPR 31; Paxus Services at ALR 733; IPR 85; (d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition. Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility. The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action: John Holland Services Pty Ltd v Terranora Group Management Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 679 ; BC200403021 at [13], [14], [17] and [73]; (e) while uncertainty as to only one element of a cause of action might be compatible with the ""reasonable cause to believe"" required by subpara (a), uncertainty as to a number of such elements may be sufficient to undermine the reasonableness of the cause to believe: Glowatzky v Insultech Group Pty Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 215 ; (f) the question posed by subpara (b) of the rule is not whether the applicant has sufficient information to decide if a cause of action is available against the prospective respondent. The question is whether the applicant has sufficient information to make a decision whether to commence proceedings in the court: Quanta Software at ALR 543 [33]-[34]; IPR 32-3, Alphapharm at 24 6. Accordingly, an applicant for preliminary discovery may be entitled to discovery in order to determine what defences are available to the respondent and the possible strength of those defences, or to determine the extent of the respondent's breach and the likely quantum of any damages award: CGU Insurance Ltd v Malaysia International Shipping Corp Berhad (2001) 187 ALR at 285 [21]; Quanta Software at ALR 543 [33]-[34]; IPR 32-3, Alphapharm at 24 6, Airservices Australia at FCR 202 3 [5]; ALR 332 (g) whether an applicant has ""sufficient information"" for the purposes of subpara (b) also requires an objective assessment to be made: Minister for Health at [44]; Alphapharm at 23 4, Hooper at FCR 12 [40]; ALR 367; IPR 31.

In SZFDZ v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [2006] FCA 974 Moore J concluded that a like application for leave should be refused and reached that conclusion "" regardless of whether the request was forwarded to the Minister "". His Honour observed: [7] The Minister submitted that the application for leave to appeal should be dismissed with costs because there were no reasonable prospects of success. First, the Federal Magistrate was clearly correct in concluding that there was no jurisdiction to review the Minister's decision for the reasons accepted by the Federal Magistrate. This was so regardless of whether the request was referred to the Minister for her personal consideration, and regardless of whether the delegate's decision was affected by jurisdictional error, notwithstanding there was no evidence at all to support such an assertion. Secondly, as was clear from s 417(7) of the Act, the Minister had no duty to consider the power under s 417, and therefore relief could not have been granted in the Court below even if there had been jurisdiction to consider the application.

Case18683,considered,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1357 ; (2005) 147 FCR 235,"There is now a considerable body of authority dealing with this provision although its proper application is not altogether free from difficulty. The first matter to emphasise about the exception in subs (3) is that it applies not to a document as such but to a representation or representations contained in a document. It is well accepted that the hearsay rule contained in s 69(2) is founded on the ""rationale of reliability"" of business records generally. The exception to that subsection is founded on a ""rationale of unreliability"" of representations made in the circumstances envisaged by subs (3): see generally Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Advanced Medical Institute Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1357 ; (2005) 147 FCR 235 at [27] . As Barrett J put the matter in Vitali v Stachnik [2001] NSWSC 303 at [12] : The purpose of the exclusion is ... to prevent the introduction through this exception to the hearsay rule of hearsay material which is prepared in an atmosphere or context which may cause it to be self-serving in the sense of possibly being prepared to assist the proof of something known or at least apprehended to be relevant to the outcome of identifiable legal proceedings. 10 The focus of the contemplation referred to in subs (3)(a) is, as Lindgren J indicated in the Advanced Medical Institute case, upon the contemplation of the person who ""prepared"" or ""obtained"" the relevant representation. As his Honour said at [25]-[27]: 25. ... In order for s 69(3)(a) to apply, a person must have ""prepared"" or ""obtained"" the representation (not the document) in contemplation of a proceeding. It is an unusual use of language to refer to the ""preparing"" of a representation, but I think that the intention is clear enough; the reference is to the person who prepared, formulated, shaped or framed the terms in which the representation is made. This will typically, perhaps always, be or include the maker of the representation. 26. The person who ""obtains"" a representation is a person who seeks the representation or procures it to be made. This person is not the maker of the representation, but may be a person who ""prepared"" it. 27. By referring to persons who prepared or obtained the representation, the legislature was attempting to encompass all those who might cause a representation to be made in the form which it takes."
Case3025,referred to,Kokatha People v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1057,"The onus of proof is on the Land Council, which must satisfy the legal burden on the balance of probabilities, but there is no reason to conclude that if the Land Council establishes a prima facie case of no native title, there is no onus on Worimi to adduce any evidence in support of his assertion of native title. In dealing with the defensive use of native title in Kokatha People v State of South Australia [2007] FCA 1057 , Finn J observed at [52] that a non-applicant native title claimant who is unable to obtain authorisation to make a s 61 claim stands in no different position than any person who claims native title but is unable to institute proceedings to have that claim established. 52 If the elements of native title are established by a non-applicant claimant, it can prevent a determination that native title does not exist, although it cannot secure a positive determination of native title under s 225 of the Act ( Kokatha at [50] per Finn J). However, Worimi's evidence may be sufficient to raise a doubt as to the non-existence of native title without amounting to proof necessary for a claimant application or for a finding that native title exists. 88 In relation to the non-claimant application for a determination that no native title exists over the Land, the following seems to me to apply: &#8226; The Act permits the making of non-claimant applications for determinations that no native title exists over land. &#8226; This allows people with interests in land to ascertain whether native title exists. The Act envisages that determinations of the absence of native title may be made and provides a statutory guarantee of validity to future acts (s 24FA). Section 61(1) provides for non-claimant applications for native title determinations. There is no indication in the Act that there is a presumption that native title exists that must be displaced by an applicant seeking a determination of the absence of native title. &#8226; The Minister has not abandoned his right to participate in these proceedings. The Minister has an interest in these proceedings, namely, to ensure that if the Court is not satisfied that there is no native title over the Land, that the Court does not make findings in relation to matters which would need to be addressed in making a positive determination of native title. The Minister also has an interest in knowing whether or not, and in what way, the Crown's radical title is burdened by native title rights and interests. In any event, the Act does not require the Minister to establish an interest in order to be party to these proceedings. &#8226; These proceedings do not enable Worimi to obtain a declaration that native title exists. In order to establish that native title exists, it is necessary to make an application under the Act and to comply with the Act and the requirements for the establishment of native title ( Kokatha ; Clifton ; Worimi 2007 ). &#8226; An applicant for a determination of the absence of native title has an onus to establish that there is no native title over the land. That onus applies to a civil standard. The applicant must demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that native title does not exist. &#8226; There is no indication in the NSW Act or the Act to indicate that the standard to be applied is other than the ordinary civil standard. &#8226; A respondent to the application may adduce evidence to cast doubt on the applicant's case. As I said in Worimi 2007 at [35], Worimi would need to advance a case that establishes that native title does exist or to cast doubt on the Land Council's evidence. Worimi's assertion of his native title rights and interests may lead to a more informed decision in the non-claimant application ( Worimi 2007 at [30]). &#8226; The decision is based upon the whole of the evidence before the Court including evidence adduced by Worimi. &#8226; The evidence adduced by Worimi should be assessed to determine whether it is sufficient to cast doubt on the Land Council's case such that the Land Council does not satisfy the Court that, on the balance of probabilities, no native title exists over the Land. &#8226; Accordingly, the onus is not on the Land Council to satisfy the Court as to the absence of each element required to prove the existence of native title. The Land Council is not required positively to establish the situation pre-sovereignty and from sovereignty to the present time with expert evidence of laws and customs. It is contrary to logic to say that a person who wishes to establish that there is no native title must first positively prove that there were laws and customs at any stage. &#8226; Worimi is the person who asserts the existence of native title. That necessarily means native title under the Act. The evidence must address the elements of such a claim, in particular the laws and customs and rights and interests from pre-sovereignty or the time of sovereignty to the present. It is not necessary to prove each element of native title but the evidence should be sufficiently cogent with respect to those elements it does address to cast doubt on the assertion that native title does not exist. If the evidence establishes the absence of a necessary element of native title, such as continuous connection with the Land, this would provide support for a determination of the absence of native title. &#8226; The Land Council may call evidence as to the existence or non-existence of laws and customs at each of those stages and as to the existence of a class or persons claiming the communal, group or individual rights. The Land Council may establish that only one necessary element is missing, such as continuous connection. That would be sufficient to establish an absence of native title. &#8226; The subject matter of this application is the land constituted by a single lot, Lot 576. Worimi contends that it is impossible to deal with Lot 576 without also considering the surrounding land. The Land Council has no obligation to demonstrate an absence of native title throughout the Port Stephens area. The evidence needs to concern the Land. However, evidence that relates to an area that goes beyond a recently subdivided lot is likely to be relevant. The question remains, however, whether there are native title rights and interests over Lot 576. &#8226; It is not in dispute that all formal requirements for a non-claimant application for a determination of the absence of native title have been met. In the absence of any evidence as to the existence of native title over the Land, the Land Council would be entitled to the determination it seeks. Both the Land Council and Worimi have adduced evidence addressing the existence of native title. It is necessary to consider the whole of that evidence to ascertain whether the Land Council has established, on the balance of probabilities, that there is no native title or whether sufficient doubt has been cast on the Land Council's case."

That case dealt with a rent review clause and a notice purportedly served pursuant to that clause. The notice was not addressed to the tenant by its proper title and was flawed in other respects. It was in the following terms: "" Without Prejudice Dear Sir, 19 Fawkon Walk, Hoddesdon. We have been instructed by your landlords, the Norwich Union Insurance Group to negotiate with you in connection with the rent review contained in your lease which becomes operative as at September 29 1982. It is out clients proposal to increase the rental to [sterling]11,500 per annum exclusive as from this date.

It is common ground between the parties that no specific form has to be adopted in order to constitute a trigger notice. Mr Wood's submission was that it should be a clear and unequivocal notice giving plain intimation to anyone receiving it of what it was. Certainly, that is, in my view, the desirable state of all such notices. But it being common ground that no special form of words is necessary no magic formula is involved the question is: trying to read it as a whole, looking at its confused terminology, its meaningless heading ""Without prejudice"" and its general ineptitude, is this a document which a tenant looking at it would think was a trigger notice?"" 42 His Lordship concluded by finding, at 43, that: ""although there are no magic words or magic formulae to be required before a rent review clause is invoked, ... the document does have to be clear and plain to any recipient."""

At first instance and on appeal, the appellants were unsuccessful. The RRT's reliance on country information was the subject of Sundberg J's and the Full Court's consideration. The appellants seek to raise again the very same ground. I accept the first respondent's submission that there is no error shown in his Honour's conclusion that res judicata applied to preclude the appellants from pursuing a second judicial review application on this ground.

Case24980,applied,Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 ,"the ability to take such matters into account as 'past and present general conduct' (or indeed as 'past and present criminal conduct' for the purposes of s 501(6)(c)(i)) is dependent on a finding that conduct of that description has occurred. In Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Baker (1997) 73 FCR 187 , a Full Court of this Court held that it was not necessary, for the purposes of taking such conduct into account, for it to have resulted in a conviction. However, the Full Court concluded at 194 that the forerunner of s 501(6)(c) was: '... concerned with a person's conduct either ""general conduct"" or conduct of a more particular kind, described as ""criminal conduct"". It is not concerned with whether the conduct has had some temporal result, such as the incurring of a conviction, but with the light that the conduct throws on the actor's character. Of course, in the absence of a prosecution and conviction, satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material: see the interesting note by B Robertson, ""Criminal Allegations in Civil Cases"" (1991) 107 LQR 194. ' In Baker the Full Court also held that the Tribunal may rely on both kinds of conduct (both criminal conduct and general conduct) in deciding whether a person fails the character test and need not anchor its decision in one of the matters mentioned in subparas (i) and (ii). A later amendment to the provisions has made this abundantly clear by the insertion of the words 'either or both of the following' in s 501(6)(c). Part 2 of Direction No 21 sets out the considerations to which decision-makers must have regard when, if the non-citizen does not pass the character test, exercising the discretion to decide whether or not the non-citizen should be permitted to enter or remain in Australia. Paragraph 2.2 provides: ' Weight of considerations 2.2 The Government is mindful of the need to balance a number of important factors in reaching a decision whether or not to refuse or cancel a visa. In making such a decision, a decision-maker should have regard to three primary considerations and a number of other considerations. The primary considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.3 2.16 and other considerations are set out at paragraphs 2.17 2.24. Decision-makers must have due regard to the importance placed by the Government on the three primary considerations, but should also adopt a balancing process which takes into account all relevant considerations.' Reference was made to what Deane J said in Pochi at 685: '[T]he Tribunal was bound, as a matter of law, to act on the basis that any conduct alleged against Mr. Pochi which was relied upon as a basis for sustaining the deportation order should be established, on the balance of probability, to its satisfaction by some rationally probative evidence and not merely raised before it as a matter of suspicion or speculation.' and to the Full Court in Baker , that 'satisfaction that criminal conduct has occurred will not be attained on slight material'. The Minister submitted that there is no basis to suggest that the Tribunal did not apply a standard of balance of probabilities. The real complaint, according to the Minister, appears to be that the Tribunal had regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports when finding that the applicant failed the character test in s 501(6)(c). As the Tribunal found that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(a) any error in also finding that the applicant failed the test in s 501(6)(c) is irrelevant. In any case, there was no reason why the Tribunal could not have regard to the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As it noted, they indicated similar behaviour to that for which the applicant had been convicted: [156]. According to the Minister, there is no error in the Tribunal's statement at [168] [169] that a substantial number of similar reports from a wide variety of different sources detailing similar conduct increases the probability that the overall picture is true. This is perfectly rational reasoning in the circumstances of this case. The weight to be attributed to particular evidence was a matter for the Tribunal: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 41 per Mason J. Given the nature of the applicant's convictions there was no reason why the Tribunal could not also have regard to other evidence of similar behaviour by the applicant when considering s 501(6)(c). In the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was not finding criminal conduct in the absence of a conviction on 'slight material' (as cautioned against in Baker at 194C), it was finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character tests in s 501(6)(a) and (c) 'on the basis of the evidence': [169], which included the applicant's criminal convictions as well as the housing department records and police intelligence reports. As 'criminal conduct' and 'general conduct' are not a dichotomy and may overlap, the Minister submitted that it was perfectly appropriate for the Tribunal to consider both together: Wong v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2002] FCAFC 440 at [33] [35]. It might be otherwise if there were no convictions and there was a finding that the applicant failed to satisfy the character test under s 501(6)(c)(i) and (ii) by recourse only to the police intelligence reports and the housing department records. In that context, the caution that came out of Baker referred to in [82] above, that there should not be a finding of criminal conduct on 'slight material', may well be apt. But that is not this case. The only real issue in the context of this case was whether the Tribunal acted capriciously in taking into account conduct referred to in the police intelligence reports and the housing department records of a kind similar to the conduct which constituted offences for which the applicant had been convicted; Ngaronoa (Jacobson J) at [60]. Clearly it did not and, unsurprisingly, there was no suggestion or submission that it did. This ground cannot sustain the application for review. The applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in finding that the applicant failed the character test under ss 501(6)(c)(i) and/or 501(6)(c)(ii) of the Act by taking into account the police intelligence reports and the housing department records concerning the applicant because in doing so it took into account irrelevant considerations. Those reports and records went into evidence; it was not articulated why the matters contained in them were irrelevant considerations to which the Tribunal could not have regard, particularly when they 'showed a continuing pattern of similar behaviour' (similar to the behaviour constituting the offences upon which the convictions were based) and 'paint a similar picture'. There is certainly no prohibition in the Act, express or implied, against taking such considerations into account. The weight to be attached to them is a different matter; it is a matter for the Tribunal, not for this Court on review of the Tribunal's decision. In my view, this ground has no merit and cannot sustain the application for review."

His Honour at 233 noted as one of the circumstances which have been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion ""an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise"". 25 In my opinion in the present case the refusal of the applicant's offer was imprudent. It was made when the parties' evidence, or at least the great bulk of it, was available in affidavit form. It would have been apparent to an objective observer that there was, at the lowest, a serious risk of a Court finding that there had been a gross misrepresentation as to the croppable areas of Broadmoor and Lower Wilmot and that this had led, along with other factors, to a gross over valuation, as demonstrated, apart from anything else, by the result of the subsequent sales. The objective observer would also have been aware that it would take a long and expensive trial for the applicant to run its case to judgment. 26 I will order that the Robinsons and Mantach pay the applicant's costs on a party and party basis up until 21 March 2007 (being 14 days from the date of the offer) and thereafter on an indemnity basis. 27 There is no opposition to an extension to 15 February 2008 of the time for filing and serving a notice of appeal.

They contended that O 35 r 7(4) conferred power to make orders that were truly supplemental and did not confer power to vary or alter the initial order. 18 Ultimately, so the respondent said, the applicants made a decision not to pay before the end of January. This decision was based on the applicants' view that it was not in their interest to pay the money at that time. The respondents submitted that they should not be penalized for the applicants' error. The respondents noted that they would be prejudiced by any variation of the kind sought in the orders of 10 October 2006 because the vehicles were likely to be worth more than $33,000."

Case20751,cited,Re Taylor; Ex parte Natwest Australia Bank Limited (1992) 37 FCR 194,"Again, as a general concept, although most people reside in only one place, residence need not be exclusive; a person may reside in more than one place ( Re Taylor; Ex parte Natwest Australia Bank Limited (1992) 37 FCR 194 at 198). For example, an individual who maintains two homes (say, one in Melbourne and one on the Gold Coast) and moves between them according to the seasons may be a resident of both places. 11 Pensions and other benefits under the Social Security Act are, of course, not available to everyone. A recipient of benefits paid for by Australian taxpayers is expected to have a connection with Australia. The necessary connection in the case of pensions and benefits payable under the Social Security Act , generally speaking, involves Australian residence. 12 A person who has reached pension age is qualified for an age pension if he or she satisfies any of the criteria specified in s 43(1) and (1A). As mentioned above, the criterion which the Tribunal found that Mrs Baccon satisfied was that she had '10 years qualifying Australian residence' (s 43(1)(a))."

Case14091,applied,Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571,"Alternatively, Smurfit seeks a stay of this proceeding on the ground that the Federal Court is a clearly inappropriate forum in accordance with the principles stated by the High Court in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Proprietary Limited [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 and Henry v Henry (1996) 185 CLR 571. 13 The fourth issue, which only arises if I am satisfied that the jurisdiction of New South Wales is non-exclusive and that Armacel is not bound by an issue estoppel, is whether this Court is a clearly inappropriate forum, ie. whether this proceeding is vexatious or oppressive in the strict sense: Voth at 564-565; Henry v Henry at 587, 591-592. 95 It is prima facie vexatious and oppressive to commence a proceeding in an Australian court if another action is already pending between the same parties, raising the same issues in another country. The existence of simultaneous proceedings with respect to the same controversy is a highly relevant consideration but it does not necessarily follow that there should be a stay of the Australian proceedings: Henry v Henry at 591-592; CSR v Cigna at 389ff . 96 The test to be applied is whether having regard to the controversy as a whole, the Australian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the Voth sense: CSR v Cigna at 401. The considerations include which forum can provide more effectively for complete resolution of the matters in controversy, which proceeding was commenced first and the stage that each of the proceedings has reached: Henry v Henry at 592. 123 The problems which arise if the same controversy is to be litigated in different countries which have jurisdiction with respect to the same matter are such that, prima facie , the continuation of one or other of them must be seen as vexatious or oppressive in the sense stated in Voth : see Henry v Henry at 591."

He referred to s 82(2) of the Act which is in the following terms: '(2) A substantive visa held by a non-citizen ceases to be in effect if another substantive visa (other than a special purpose visa) for the non-citizen comes into effect.'
Case264,considered,Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358,"And finally, there are observations by Heerey J in Andi-Co Australia Pty Ltd v Meyers [2004] FCA 1358 , which are apposite in the context of the affidavit material filed in the present application. Heerey J said of the case before him at [17]: ... Mr Meyers has filed a substantial amount of affidavit material sworn by himself and others. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the issue is not whether his version of events is more plausible than Andi-Co's, but whether the alleged debts are the subject of genuine disputes and whether the alleged offsetting claims are genuine, that is to say, real and authentic as opposed to false, illegitimate, phoney, counterfeit and false. Accordingly, I shall not engage in an assessment of the rival merits. 18 The plaintiff asserts two offsetting claims. The first of the offsetting claims relates to what is said to be a genuine claim of the plaintiff against the defendant for the infringement of three patents, arising out of the defendant's manufacture and sale of water meter assemblies. 19 The second offsetting claim relates to an order for costs made in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant by me on 9 August 2004 in action Q69 of 2003."
Case12187,cited,Mobileworld Operating Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Limited [2005] FCA 1365,"As was pointed out by Weinberg J in Mobileworld Operating Pty Ltd v Telstra Corporation Limited [2005] FCA 1365 at par [21] : ""The threshold for 'a serious question to be tried' is not particularly onerous"". 16 Although there may be a dispute as to some of the relevant facts involving the activities of the second respondent and Mr Locke prior to the painting of the first respondent's store in Cheltenham Road, there is no real factual dispute about the painting and get up of the respondents' store. Further, there was no challenge by the respondents to the fact that the name ""Clark Rubber"" had become distinctive and was capable of appropriate protection. However, this case is not about the appropriation of a name but rather about the appropriation of get up, albeit in the context of a colour scheme. 17 The respondents submitted that the first respondent's premises was sufficiently dissimilar in its appearance to the Clark Rubber stores and it did not an amount to an attempt to pass itself off as a Clark Rubber store. Further, the respondents contended that there was no proprietorial stake in the colour yellow per se which they contended was the yardstick of the applicants' claim. The respondents also contended that the use of the ""Oasis Foam &amp; Rubber"" logo would be sufficient to enable customers not to be misled as to the identity or association of the first respondent's store."
Case7239,referred to,Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385,"Another matter relevant to insolvency is the prospect of funds likely to be available from a third party, such as from a capital injection or a subordinated loan. The Court will generally be sceptical of a mere assertion of a third party's willingness to provide such support. Such asserted willingness should be cogently demonstrated as a matter of commercial reality, even if the evidence falls short of establishing a legal obligation to advance funds: see the discussion in Lewis v Doran [2004] NSWSC 608 ; (2004) 208 ALR 385 per Palmer J at [112], [113]. That topic, too, was a matter upon which there was some difference between the parties, but for reasons which are discussed below, I do not think it is significant in this instance because there is so little evidence of any real prospect of any third party capital funding becoming available. In the end result, senior counsel for the creditor did not place much weight on the prospect of an externally sourced capital injection of funds to show whether Damilock was insolvent prior to about 12 February 2007. 22 As I indicated, Mr Lewis' conclusion was that Damilock was insolvent from at least early December 2006 and certainly by 26 December 2006 and remained insolvent until 26 June 2007. He expressed that view because, in the whole of that period, Damilock had a deficiency in its cash flow needed to pay its debts which had become due and payable, based upon hypothetical bank balance assessments which he had prepared. He recognised that conclusion was based upon an assumption that Damilock's creditors were paid on 30 day terms. On that basis, he concluded that Damilock would have required an increase in its overdraft facility in excess of $6m, increasing perhaps to $8m plus by 26 June 2007, to meet its debts as and when they fell due during that period. He did alternative calculations based upon creditor payment terms of 60 and 90 days. They did not alter his conclusion, albeit that the increased overdraft facility required would have been considerably less. He also concluded on his balance sheet analysis that Damilock had a material deficiency in its working capital of $528,000 as at 31 December 2006 increasing to $4,896,000 at 30 June 2007, and that those figures were conservative as they did not take account of non-current employee entitlements such as long service leave, and depreciation. 23 Mr Keith's view was that Damilock was not insolvent prior to 12 February 2007, and became insolvent some time between that date and 14 March 2007. He identified the reasons for his conclusion, differing from that of Mr Lewis, as being: 1. Damilock was in ongoing discussions with potential equity investors at least in the period up to 12 February 2007; 2. Damilock had achieved a large net profit of $530,000 in January 2007, so as to have given Damilock's directors reason to expect that, at that time, its profitability and cash flow was improving significantly; 3. Damilock had engaged Korda Mentha, ""highly regarded reconstruction and insolvency experts""; and 4. a report prepared by Korda Mentha as at 13 February 2007 did not state or express the opinion that Damilock was then insolvent, but indicated that Korda Mentha were in discussions with Damilock's directors so that Damilock was pursuing strategies to preserve the integrity of the continuing business."
Case865,discussed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61,"Since writing these reasons for judgment, I have become aware of the judgment of the Full Court in Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs v Lay Lat [2006] FCAFC 61. That judgment deals with an appeal by the Minister from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court, which quashed a decision of a delegate of the Minister to refuse a Business Skills Migrant visa to the respondent to the appeal, a person who had applied from outside Australia for that visa. The issue was whether the respondent had been denied what the Full Court called 'common law procedural fairness', because the decision-maker did not draw to the respondent's attention the point on which the decision against him turned. If the respondent were entitled to succeed on that issue, there was then an issue as to whether a right to procedural fairness was excluded by s 51A of the Migration Act , a provision in terms similar to both s 357A and s 422B , but relating to decisions by the Minister or delegates of the Minister. At [46] [59], the Full Court held that there had been no denial of procedural fairness, because the relevant point was obvious to the respondent. The Full Court then proceeded, at [60] [70], to make some observations, which are clearly obiter, on the effect of s 51A. Following VXDC v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1388 (2005) 146 FCR 562, the Full Court expressed the view that s 51A operates to exclude the 'common law natural justice hearing rule' altogether. 97 To the extent to which Lay Lat might be taken to be authority on the meaning and effect of s 357A of the Migration Act , it does not bind me to hold that Ms Antipova's only entitlement to procedural fairness is to be found in the meagre provisions of Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Migration Act . In my view, to the extent that it suggests that s 422B excludes all principles of procedural fairness, other than those found in Div 4 of Pt 7 of the Migration Act , VXDC is fundamentally wrong. The obiter remarks in Lay Lat are entitled to great respect, appearing as they do in a considered judgment of a Full Court, but I cannot bring myself to accept that they are correct. For the reasons I gave in Moradian v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 1590 (2004) 142 FCR 170 at [28] , I remain of the view that the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with', appearing in each of ss 51A , 357A and 422B of the Migration Act are intended to qualify the words preceding them, and to reduce what would otherwise be the absolute effect of those exclusionary words. If this were not the case, the words 'in relation to the matters it deals with' would be otiose, and it is not to be supposed that Parliament intended to enact meaningless, surplus words in a crucial amendment. The words are not the 'plain words of necessary intendment' required to exclude the requirements of procedural fairness. See Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ, and the authorities there cited. It is highly unlikely that Parliament had in mind all of the myriad ways in which procedural fairness, a concept the content of which is dependent on the circumstances of each case, could arise. The present case forms a good example of what would result if the view expressed in Lay Lat were to be followed. Assuming that s 360(1) of the Migration Act does not have the meaning that it has in my view, the Tribunal could reduce the time of a hearing arbitrarily as much as it chose, interrupt and curtail the evidence of the applicant constantly, and deprive the applicant of any opportunity to put his or her case, and the applicant would have no redress. It is impossible to imagine that Parliament intended such a drastic result. 98 To the extent to which the views expressed in VXDC and Lay Lat are said to be based on a reading of the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech relating to the bill by which ss 51A , 357A and 422B were introduced into the Migration Act , I repeat the view I expressed in Moradian at [35]. Those documents do not contain statements specific enough to resolve any ambiguity in those provisions, or to disclose a purpose specific enough to warrant a construction of the provisions that would regard them as excluding the entirety of the principle of procedural fairness described as the 'natural justice hearing rule'. 99 For these reasons, if it is necessary to ask the question whether Ms Antipova is entitled to succeed on the basis that the Tribunal denied her procedural fairness, by the manner in which it conducted her hearing, I do not regard VXDC and Lay Lat as requiring me to take a view different from that I have expressed above."
Case10771,cited,"Re Spedley Securities Ltd (In liq) (1992) 10 ACLC 1,742","In the light of the Harmer Report and Young J's observations, Austin J characterised the court's approval under s 477(2B) thus (at 1,650): ... the court's approval is not an endorsement of the proposed agreement but is merely a permission for the liquidator to exercise his or her own commercial judgment in the matter. His Honour also approved the application to the exercise of the discretion under s 477(2B) of principles adopted by Mandie J in Re Aslor Pty Ltd (1997) 15 ACLC 1,412. That case concerned an agreement of more than three months duration involving compromise of a claim against the company. Mandie J followed principles applicable to the approval of compromises enunciated by Giles J in Re Spedley Securities Ltd (in liq) (1992) 10 ACLC 1,742. On those principles the Court does not rubber stamp the liquidator's proposal. Nevertheless it will not generally interfere unless there is some want of good faith, error of law or principle, or real and substantial grounds for doubting the prudence of the liquidator's proposal. While the principles so adopted by Mandie J and approved by Austin J related to approval of compromises, they seem to me to have wider application to the exercise of the discretion generally under s 477(2B)."

In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Ithaca Ice Works Pty Ltd (2002) ATPR 41-851 at 44,543, the Full Court raised the issue of the dispute in relation to the role of punishment in imposing penalties. The Full Court noted: ""...we see little or indeed no difference between taking into account, in computing the penalty, the deliberate nature of the conduct in question (a matter the relevance of which is not in dispute) and taking into account the fact that the penalty should act as a punishment of the offender."""
Case3240,cited,A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227,"I accept that Tribunals, and particularly lay Tribunals, sometimes assert that there is 'no evidence' on an issue when they mean that, although there is some evidence on the issue, they do not regard the evidence as sufficient to support a particular finding (see, for example A v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 227 at [23] - [27] and Wickramasinghe v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 30 at [18] ). In every case the meaning intended to be conveyed by the Tribunal is to be determined by reference to the language used by the Tribunal understood in the context provided by the Tribunal's reasons for decision as a whole. In this case, having twice asserted that there was 'no evidence' of a particular character, the Tribunal went on to state that the appellant had not provided 'any information which would support [his] claim other than his own speculative assertion' . I conclude that the Tribunal's language, understood in the context provided by its written reasons as a whole, suggests that the Tribunal intended to convey that there was no evidence at all on the two matters identified by it."

Case9254,referred to,Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1400,"Such matters are generally not capable of precise arithmetical calculation or analysis and are to a considerable extent matters of impression and judgment. See by analogy Dias Aluminium Products Pty Ltd v Ullrich Aluminium Pty Ltd (No 2) [2005] FCA 1400 at [7] . 20 I also consider that this conduct led to wasted costs in relation to much of the evidence of the respondents' expert Mr John Permewan. I did not afford his evidence any weight, because as I found, he was significantly misdirected by Metricon on a number of significant matters and was not told in the witness box before giving evidence about significant revisions to Metricon's witness statements. As a result, his opinions as to independent derivation were founded upon significantly incorrect assumptions and were of no real assistance to the Court. One example of this was that he incorrectly assumed that the Tyrell, Connolly and Streeton designs and homes were not designed by reference to the Prada 35. In fact, as I found, they were. He did not deal expressly in his report with the actual design drawings from which, according to the respondents, Prototypes 20A and 20B were derived. He assumed that certain evidence given by Bugeja, but which was disavowed by him at trial, was correct and he relied upon it. He accepted that Gallery 32 was used in the derivation of Prada 35. It was not. [252]-[256] Furthermore the applicants put the respondents on notice that Mr Permewan had been misinstructed. The solicitors for the applicants wrote to the respondents' solicitors by letter dated 9 October 2006 stating amongst other things that: Mr Permewan has proffered views about whether or not copying occurred by reference to his beliefs based on the untested evidence of Metricon's witnesses. It is clear from his report that Mr Permewan has taken as truthful, and without qualification, the evidence of Metricon's lay witnesses. I accept that consideration of Mr Permewan's affidavit evidence would have required significant amount of time before analysis on the part of the applicants' solicitors and counsel and indeed also by Dr John Cooke the expert architect obtained by the applicants. The matters deposed to by these lay witnesses may be overridden by the impressions formed by the Court following cross-examination. 21 The respondents should be ordered to pay costs on an indemnity basis to the extent of 50% of the preparation for trial and for the trial itself. The order should cover the period from early April 2006 when the respondents filed the first of the affidavits of Bugeja, Popple, Palazzesi and Biasin."
Case2141,cited,Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela (1990) 19 IPR 435,"the Court has not had the benefit of submissions from the respondents on these points. However, the visual similarity in the tees is clear. Gummow J in Wanem Pty Ltd v John Tekiela (1990) 19 IPR 435 at 15 said 'the design applies to the appearance of the article as a whole and issues of infringement are to be approached with that in mind'. Prima facie , there is a case that the tees sold by the first respondent infringe the Registered Design of the applicants under the Designs Act 1906 (Cth). Further, there is affidavit evidence from the applicants that at least some infringing kicking tees are being sold in stores operated by the first respondents. Finally, there is evidence before the Court, including correspondence from the respondents, which supports the third contention of the applicants in relation to the conduct of the respondents. In my view, these issues indicate that there is a serious question to be tried. 2. Damages insufficient In their written submissions and in oral submissions this morning the applicants submitted that whilst an account of profits or damages in respect of the infringements to date are sought in the eventual trial, long term damage to the market for kicking tees to which their Registered Design has been legitimately applied is of most concern."

Rather than this Court being under a possible "" duty ... not to proceed "", Ms Mead was anxious for this Court to hear and resolve her claims immediately. Such a position, it may be noted, was inconsistent with the application to have the appeals in effect adjourned.

Case21494,cited,Olivaylle Pty Limited v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 3) [2008] FCA 572 ; (2008) 76 IPR 152,"Lorenz was not initially a witness whom Flottweg proposed to call. After the expiry of the time fixed by direction for the filing of evidence in chief and for that matter after Olivaylle had closed its case, Flottweg made application for leave to file an affidavit made by him upon which, as events transpired, he came to be cross-examined. For reasons which I gave in the course of the trial, I permitted Flottweg to adduce evidence from him: Olivaylle Pty Limited v Flottweg GMBH &amp; Co KGAA (No 3) [2008] FCA 572 ; (2008) 76 IPR 152. Mr Lorenz was at the time of his involvement with events of present relevance and remains by occupational title a sales engineer. From about 2003 he has had worldwide responsibility within Flottweg for that company's dealings in the field of edible oils, which includes olive oil production. He had the benefit of being trained for his current role by his predecessor, a Mr Langenbrink, whom he replaced on the latter's retirement and a Mr Ecker, the Group leader of Flottweg's Edible Fats Oil Division, who retired in 2006. Each of Messrs Ecker and Langenbrink had extensive experience in the provision and servicing of production line machinery for the olive oil industry internationally. Mr Lorenz also has what I regard as the benefit of having carried out technical repairs, servicing, start up testing and operator training in respect of Flottweg decanters, tricanters, belt presses and Veronesi separators (and the associated plant such as polymer stations and screw conveyors) over a period of some 15 years prior to assuming the role of sales engineer. He undertook this work on joining Flottweg after his completion of a trade apprenticeship with one of its competitors. His title ""sales engineer"" gives an accurate idea of his current role. He is not just an equipment salesman. He is able to and does bring to the task of equipment sales an ability to assess and advise upon the performance characteristics, limitations and other technical aspects of Flottweg's machinery and production lines into which such machinery will be integrated based on both formal trade qualifications and, especially, years of relevant, practical experience with the machinery."

The kind of evidence adduced on a preliminary inquiry of this kind should be in proportion to the nature of such an interlocutory issue. The purpose of the inquiry is to determine by way of a mini rather than a mega trial whether the applicant has a prima facie case (per Beaumont J in WSGAL Pty Limited v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 510 ; (1992) 39 FCR 472 at 476). Whatever is required to satisfy the court that there is a prima facie case, that satisfaction should leave open the possibility that the respondent could move to strike out the statement of claim or invoke s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ('Federal Court Act'), which makes provision for orders for, amongst other things, summary dismissal or provisions of the Rules which provide for the summary disposition of proceedings. To do otherwise may be setting too high a threshold for service out of the jurisdiction."
Case22781,cited,Maguire v Makaronis [1997] HCA 23 ; (1997) 188 CLR 449,"And, Brennan CJ, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ said in Maguire v Makaronis [1997] HCA 23 ; (1997) 188 CLR 449 at 466 (footnote omitted) (which was approved by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ in Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22 at [107] ): 'What is required for a fully informed consent is a question of fact in all the circumstances of each case and there is no precise formula which will determine in all cases if fully informed consent has been given.' 40 The sufficiency of disclosure by a fiduciary can depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the person to whom it is made, so that it can truly be said that his or her consent is fully informed. That is a question of fact in all cases ( Farah Constructions [2007] HCA 22 at [107] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ). Because I am of opinion that no fiduciary obligation arose, it is irrelevant for me to consider the question of sufficiency of disclosure in the context of whether the proposed amendment is fairly arguable (cf: Pilmer v Duke Group Ltd (In Liq) [2001] HCA 31 ; (2001) 207 CLR 165 at 198-199 [77] - [79] per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ)."
Case20033,referred to,Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511,"The originating process and pleadings in proceedings initiated in a court of justice such as this court with rules such as O 46 r 6, are intended by the rules of the court to be available to the public. That is so that they may see what is the controversy brought to the court for resolution by it in its ordinary function as a court constituted under Chapter III of the Constitution . That function is to resolve controversies that arise under laws of the Commonwealth or under the Constitution itself and to determine finally all matters in dispute between the parties. Hence, the jurisdiction of this court to deal finally with the whole of the matter between parties even though only a part of it, and perhaps only a small part of it, involves an issue which is a 'matter' within the meaning of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution : see Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511. 29 It was suggested by senior counsel for Nine Network yesterday that what appears on page 7 in the statement of claim was a confidential matter involving a private communication within the Nine Network companies and was only of prurient interest to those seeking to exercise their right to inspect under O 46 r 6. That was put as a substantive basis for the resistance to the right of access being afforded and a suggestion that the material was confidential within the terms of r 6(1). 30 The allegation the subject of that submission was that on or about 11 January 2006 Mr Llewellyn was directed by an agent of Nine Network to prepare a news story attacking Mr Kerry Stokes of Channel 7 in relation to a news story on Channel 7 which in turn had attacked Mr James Packer. Mr Llewellyn alleged that he refused to follow that direction. There was then another allegation that a week later he was directed by Mr Chisholm to terminate a Mr John Lyons' employment due to what was alleged to be poor performance. Mr Lyons was at that time employed in the position of an executive director of the Sunday program."
Case16203,considered,"Phoenix Court Pty Ltd v Melbourne Central Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 at 54,432","Section 51A does not provide an independent cause of action separate from s 52 or other sections in Part V of the Act ( Phoenix Court Pty Ltd v Melbourne Central Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 at 54,432, cf Sykes v Reserve Bank of Australia (1998) 88 FCR 511 at 513-514). Rather, s 51A provides, in summary, that where a corporation makes a representation with respect to any future matter and it does not have reasonable grounds for making the representation, the representation shall be taken to be misleading (s 51A(1)). Section 51A in that respect is a ""subset of section 52"": Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 , Sykes 88 FCR 511 at 514, Quinlivan v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 175 at [5] ). I shall consider s 51A in further detail later in this judgment in the context of the future representations alleged by the applicants. 277 It has been suggested that, because the deeming within the meaning of s 51A(2) takes effect unless the corporation adduces some evidence to the contrary, this does not mean that the onus of proof (which otherwise lies with the applicant) is reversed, but merely requires the corporation to go into evidence ( ACCC v Universal Sports Challenge Ltd [2002] FCA 1276 at [46] ). The weight of authority however is that the person making the representation can only avoid the deeming in s 51A(2) by establishing on the usual balance of probabilities that there were reasonable grounds for making the representation: Lewarne v Momentum Productions Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1136 at [82] , Ting [1993] FCA 524 ; 118 ALR 543 at 552, Bowler v Hilda Pty Ltd (1998) 153 ALR 95 at 108 and 117, Sykes 88 FCR 511 at 513-514, Adelaide Petroleum NL &amp; Ors v Poseidon Limited &amp; Ors (1988) 10 ATPR 40-901 at 49,700, Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 (and cf other cases in support of this proposition listed at Miller , 29th ed para 1.51A.37). 279 The effect of s 51A was encapsulated neatly by Goldberg J in Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 where his Honour observed: Section 51A does not create an independent cause of action separate from section 52 and other sections in Pt V of the Act but rather casts the burden of proof on the respondent and if that burden is not discharged then a breach of s52 is established by the applicant proving the representation as to the future matter and the fact that it did not come to pass. 280 Clearly whether the representor had ""reasonable grounds"" to make the relevant representation will depend upon the facts of the case in question. I consider this issue later in the judgment. 281 A second general observation with respect to the future representations concerns the applicants' claim that each budgetary forecast as to a future matter ""would be"" as is recorded in the budget. This expression appears in the Further Amended Statement of Claim in para 13(a)-(c), para 16(a)-(d) and para 17(c) and (d) with respect to budgeted costs and returns; paras 13(a)-(d) and 16 (a)-(d) with respect to projected fruit crops; para 13(d) and 16(d) with respect to packout rates; and para 16(f) with respect to yield. 321 The reasons given for this approach were that: &#8226; in relation to validation of the yield data the DPI publication was published in 1994 and specifically concerned the Central Burnett region as distinct from the South Burnett region where the relevant properties were located; and &#8226; in relation to providing an opinion as to packout rates Mr Frick stated in his expert report that information had been gained directly from industry contacts because there was no published data available to work with. (Frick expert report p 3). 322 Mr Frick did not identify the persons whom he consulted to validate the yield data or ascertain the packout rate information, although he did say during cross-examination that he had contacted four separate people: &#8226; one of the persons he contacted had a property half way between Bundaberg and Tiaro; &#8226; one of the persons was a Central Burnett grower; &#8226; the other people he contacted were citrus agricultural consultants. 323 In his expert report he stated: This information is in my notes and is not tendered as reference information. (Frick expert report p 2) 412 Accordingly: &#8226; The evidence demonstrates that the relevant properties were not maintained as orchards for the 2005 calendar year (or indeed the balance of the 2004-2005 financial year), and accordingly were not conducted after 23 June 2005 in such a manner as to earn revenue or profit, incur costs or cause fruit to be picked. &#8226; The evidence demonstrates that, objectively, the events predicted by the respondents' future representations in the 2005 Sunstate Budget.xls (the subject of para 13) did not occur. In the words of Goldberg J in Phoenix Court Pty Ltd (1997) ATPR 46-179 , the events did not come to pass. Sections 51A and 52 are thus enlivened."
Case20478,distinguished,Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402,"The respondents relied on Morton v The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited [1951] HCA 42 ; (1951) 83 CLR 402. In that case the High Court held (at 410) that reg 188 of the Excise Regulations 1925 (Cth) were ultra vires the Excise Act 1901 (Cth) and void because regulations cannot vary or depart from the positive provisions made by the Act or... go outside the field of operation which the Act marks out for itself. The regulation in question was invalid because it imposed ""a distinct and independent addition of liability to the liabilities which the legislature has provided"" (at 412). 18 In the present case the respondents eschewed any argument that reg 2.14 was ultra vires and therefore void. 19 The present case is not like Morton where the statute covered the field and left no room for regulations. On the contrary, the scheme of both Old Act and New Act is to leave to the regulations questions of who may enforce."
Case4270,cited,St. George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147,"As to the settled principles to be applied in an application pursuant to O 15A, r 6, the principles are these: the rule is to be beneficially construed and afforded the fullest scope its language reasonably allows; the 'proper brake' upon any excesses in the application of the rule lies in the exercise of the court's discretion ; the test for determining 'reasonable cause to believe' is an objective one; 'reasonable cause to believe' strikes a relationship with whether the applicant has a right to obtain particular relief or whether the applicant may have a right to relief and thus hypothecates a remedial outcome in the proposed proceedings on the assumption the evidence makes out each integer in the applicant's cause of action; such a belief, on either footing, requires more than mere assertion, suspicion or conjecture; a mere possibility of a right to relief is insufficient; the evidence, that is, an assessment of all the evidence, must incline the mind towards acceptance of the existence of a matter or fact in controversy out of which a right to relief arises or may arise; it is no answer to an application under O 15A, r 6 to say that the proceeding is in the nature of a 'fishing expedition'; the rule contemplates that an applicant will forensically examine the field of documents the subject of the order expressly for the purpose of enabling a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding; although the rule contemplates such an examination of the respondent's documents the subject of the order, the invasive nature of the order is predicated upon an objectively established reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have a right to contended relief; although an applicant does not need to establish a prima facie case, an applicant must establish that there is a reasonable cause to believe that each element of the potential cause of action is made out; although the threshold test may be set at quite a low level, the evidence must establish facts crystallising all the elements of a cause of action grounding the possible grant of the contended relief (see: St. George Bank Ltd v Rabo Australia Ltd (2004) 211 ALR 147 per Hely J [25] [29]; Hooper &amp; Ors v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1 at pp 11 and 12 per Wilcox, Sackville and Katz JJ [35] [40]; Glencore International AG v Selwyn Mines Ltd (2006) 223 ALR 238 at pp 240 and 241 [8] [16] per Lindgren J; C7 Pty Ltd v Foxtel Management Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1864 at [12] per Gyles J)."
Case17645,cited,Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC (2008) 26 ACLC 506,"question arises under s 468(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth): Carringbush Corporation Pty Ltd v ASIC [2008] FCA 474; (2008) 26 ACLC 506. Put in simple terms, the following distributions occurred in the 2001 income year. CEPL as trustee of the CU Trust distributed the entire income of the trust to or for the benefit of a discretionary unit holder, DCE Holdings Pty Ltd (""Clark Holdings"") as trustee of the David Clark Family Trust (the ""Clark Family Trust""). Clark Holdings distributed the income so received to David Clark Enterprises Pty Ltd (""Clark Enterprises"") as trustee of the David Clark Enterprises Trust (the ""Enterprises Trust"") and Clark Enterprises distributed the income of the trust to David Clark and Helen Clark in equal shares as beneficiaries of that trust. By s 97 of the 1936 Act, the assessable income of David Clark and Helen Clark includes a 50% share of the net income of the Enterprises Trust and in the event that the taxpayers are not able to establish that the CU Trust estate suffered previously unapplied net capital losses extinguishing the net capital gain arising out of the disposal of the Gladstone properties in the 2001 income year, the net income of the Enterprises Trust will also include a significant part of the net capital gain (discounted by 50%) made by the CU Trust in the 2001 income year. Accordingly, the first question to be determined in these proceedings is whether the applicants have discharged the onus of establishing that in the 1988 income year, the trustee of the CU Trust acquired the Rothwells shares."
Case24632,cited,White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298,"The intent of s 31A is to enable summary judgment to be obtained even in circumstances where a consideration of prior authorities such as Dey v Victorian Railway Commissioners [1949] HCA 1 ; (1949) 78 CLR 62 and General Steel Industries Inc v Commissioner for Railways [1964] HCA 69 ; (1964) 112 CLR 125 , which had hitherto informed an assessment on summary judgment of no reasonable prospect of success, might have suggested that an application for summary judgment should be dismissed. In White Industries Aust Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 Lindgren J made a number of observations in relation to the changes wrought by s 31A to the determination of a summary judgment application. Many other judges of this Court, including me (q v Granitgard Pty Ltd v Termicide Pest Control Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 55) , have gained assistance from those observations. Having regard to those observations, I approach the application made by the Respondents on the basis that a reasonable prospect of success for the purposes of the section is one which is real, not fanciful or merely arguable. So approaching the matter, my opinion is that the substantive application has no reasonable prospect of success."
Case4262,considered,R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13,"Given that QWI was an active contradictor, the Delegate properly took the stance of abiding the order of the court and not wishing to be heard save if need be in respect of costs: R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; ex parte Hardiman [1980] HCA 13 ; (1980) 144 CLR 13 , at 17, 35-36. 12 For the reasons which follow, I have concluded that the various grounds upon which, by their amended application, the Applicants sought the judicial review of the agreement registration decision do not lead to the result that the decision should be set aside. Work done under the Traveston Dam Agreement is therefore a valid future act for the purposes of the Native Title Act . 13 The grounds of review which came to be advanced by the Applicants are set out below: 1. The First Respondent erred in law and/or improperly exercised the power conferred upon her in finding that the requirements of Section 24CG(3)(b) of the Native Title Act had been satisfied in circumstances where: (a) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the Gubbi Gubbi People and the Kabi Kabi People were part of the same wider group; (b) The First Respondent failed to take into account the following relevant considerations in reaching the conclusion that the Gubbi Gubbi People and the Kabi Kabi People were part of the same wider group: (i) That membership of the Gubbi Gubbi People was based on matrilineal descent from the apical ancestors James Crowe and Maggie Palmer whereas membership of the Kabi Kabi People was based on cognatic descent from a number of apical ancestors in addition to James Crowe and Maggie Palmer; and (ii) That the Gubbi Gubbi People have a mandatory traditional decision making process in relation to matters affecting land involving the reaching of a consensus decision by the Elders of the respective family groups within the clan without recourse to a majority vote of the group as adopted by the Kabi Kabi People when purporting to authorise the ILUA. (c) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably be satisfied that the Gubbi Gubbi People did not adhere to a mandatory traditional decision making process as aforesaid; (d) The First Respondent failed to take into consideration the fact that the Gubbi Gubbi People both before and at the authorisation meeting disputed the decision making process adopted at the authorisation meeting and did not authorise the making of the ILUA; (e) The First Respondent concluded that there was no mandatory traditional decision making process applicable to the subject decision in reliance upon evidence that emanated from persons who where no traditional custodians of such information; (f) There was no evidence from which the First Respondent could reasonably have concluded that the Gubbi Gubbi People withdrew from the agreement making process; (g) The evidence showed that the Gubbi Gubbi People were not afforded the opportunity to separately consider the terms of the ILUA in accordance with the their mandatory traditional decision making process, in circumstances where the persons said to hold native title where encompassed by three separately represented constituent groups; (h) By reason of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1(a) (g) hereof the Applicants are not bound by the Kabi Kabi Peoples authorisation decision and did not themselves authorise the meeting of the ILUA. 2. The First Respondent erred in law and/or improperly exercise the power conferred on her in: (a) Limiting her registration decision to the criteria set out in Section 24CL of the Native Title Act ; (b) Failing to consider or properly consider whether the ILUA was an area agreement that complied with the requirements of Sections 24CB and 24CE of the Native Title Act . (c) Failing to find that the Cultural Heritage Investigation Management Agreement (""the CHIMA"") component of the ILUA contravened the provisions of the ACHA and so by reason of Section 24CE of the Native Title Act , that the ILUA was invalid either in whole or in part and was thereby no an area agreement capable of being registered. (d) Failing to find that the CHIMA component of the ILUA in so far as it dealt with the regulation of Cultural Heritage matters over land where Native Title rights had been extinguished was no properly the subject matter of an area agreement pursuant to Section 24CB of the Native title Act and thereby the ILUA was not an area agreement capable of being registered. Particulars (a) The CHIMA regulates Aboriginal Cultural Heritage matters as defined in the ACHA over areas where Native Title rights have been extinguished; and (b) To the extent that the ILUA deal with areas where Native Title rights have been extinguished: (i) The Aboriginal Party under the ACHA ought to have been a party to the ILUA as required by Section 23(3)(a)(iii) of the ACHA; (ii) The Aboriginal ILUA Parties did not have standing under the Native Title Act to enter into ILUA which purported to regulate Aboriginal Cultural Heritage matters over such areas; and (iii) It is not competent for an ILUA to deal with Cultural Heritage maters properly regulated by existing State legislation over land where Native Title rights do not exist."

In consequence it stands as a valid and conclusive order of a superior court of record unless and until it is set aside: see Siminton v Australian Prudential Regulation Authority [2006] FCAFC 118 at [27] - [30] . 30 As best I can understand the changing picture presented by counsel for Mr Cirillo in submissions it has no reflection in the present pleadings the damages claimed for the proposed tort of abuse of process include, it would seem, at least that part of his own solicitor and client costs in the inquiry as to damages which were incurred in consequence of the conduct of the respondents alleged to give rise to the tort. I am uncertain what else the damages would include although it again seems likely that, as in the present application, Mr Cirillo would also be attempting to be relieved indirectly of the obligation to pay some, or part of, the monies he has been ordered to pay under the consent order."
Case10873,cited,O R Cormack Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1992) 92 ATC 4121,"French J drew attention to the statutory context and the general principles that the classification of goods attracting exemptions or beneficial rates of tax should be liberally construed unless the text or context requires a narrower construction, and that words or phrases should be construed according to their popular meaning unless the evidence establishes that they carry a special commercial or trade meaning in their context: at 457 and 464. His Honour also noted that generalisations about the construction of statutory classifications are to be undertaken with caution, and that subtle changes in language can significantly alter the meaning and operation of a particular provision. French J contrasted the construction given by the authorities to the expression 'ordinarily used for household purposes' with the construction given to the expression 'goods for use' in some specified activity or by some specified person or entity. The former expression has attracted an objective test for characterisation of the goods said to fall within it: see Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Newbound &amp; Co Pty Ltd (1952) 10 ATD 59; 26 ALJR 386 at 387 per Dixon CJ; Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Sherwood Overseas Pty Ltd (1985) 75 FLR 474 at 477; O R Cormack Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1992) 92 ATC 4121 at 4123; and Hygienic Lily at 399. In the light of these authorities, French J expressed the test as follows, at 460: 'The question whether goods are ""ordinarily used for household purposes"" does not depend critically upon the use to which they are in fact put but on an assessment of their ""essential character"". That assessment does not involve fine semantic distinctions but a judgment which pays regard to the commercial realities of their manufacture and sale.'"
Case23458,referred to,Audio Products Group Pty Ltd v Mamone [2005] NSWSC 982,"The respondents' submission that Mr Donovan, as a member of a class of possible objects of appointment, has no proprietary interest in the trust assets is correct: In re Coleman; Henry v Strong (1888) 39 Ch D 443 ; In re Weir's Settlement Trusts; Macpherson v Inland Revenue Commissioners [1971] Ch 145. However, I do not think that is fatal to the applicants' application. I say that for the following reason. I think the test formulated by the High Court in Cardile ((ii) in the passage quoted above at [15]) and reflected in O 25A r 5(5) is wide enough to cover the present circumstances. Both refer to a process which ""is or may ultimately be available"" and the fact that the third party "" may be obliged to disgorge assets"" or contribute towards satisfying the judgment or prospective judgment. It is possible that Mr Donovan will receive an interest under the Stephen Donovan Family Trust which is recoverable by a trustee in bankruptcy in the event that the applicants obtain a judgment against Mr Donovan and he is placed into bankruptcy upon being unable to satisfy that judgment. I am mindful of the fact that considerable caution must be exercised in making freezing orders against third parties, but at the same time there needs to be some flexibility in the test, as the circumstances of this case plainly show. Other courts have considered that the use of the word ""may"" is significant: Westpac Banking Corporation v Hilliard [2001] VSC 187 ; Audio Products Group Pty Ltd v Mamone [2005] NSWSC 982 ; Robmatjus Pty Ltd v Violet Home Loans Australia Pty Ltd [2007] VSC 165."
Case4487,considered,Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328,"The applicant justifies the raising of those issues for the first time on appeal on the basis of an asserted obligation of the Tribunal to inquire into and correctly consider questions of law arising on the matter before it, even in the face of concessions or admissions by the parties. It relies upon Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328 at [36] [39] for that proposition. 32 I do not consider that that decision supports its contention. That case relevantly concerned the question of whether the Tribunal had erred in failing to address the question under s 24(2)(c) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) of whether the employee claiming compensation had undertaken all reasonable rehabilitative treatment for the impairment which was compensable. That consideration was relevant to whether the injury had resulted in permanent impairment, so as to entitle the employee concerned to a lump sum compensation payment. The Full Court (Drummond, Kiefel and Dowsett JJ) at [39] said: The Tribunal is not, as a general rule, required to ignore the fact that one or both parties have made admissions or concessions, express or implied, that particular issues which the original decision-maker may have had to consider need not be the subject of inquiry and determination by the Tribunal. The Tribunal will, however, fall into error of law by failing to inquire of its own motion into, and make a finding on, an issue the subject of an admission or concession by a party that is material to its decision if there is reason to doubt that the admission or concession is factually justified. But in the absence of there being some reason to question the admission or concession, the Tribunal will generally be entitled not to inquire into the issue for itself, but to act on that admission or concession in making its decision. 33 In my judgment, the conduct of the matter before the Tribunal clearly indicates that, at least impliedly, the applicant did not seek to ventilate the issues arising under ss 10(7) or 63 of the Act, and restricted itself to the matters which the Tribunal identified. The Tribunal in those circumstances was quite entitled to proceed upon the basis that those matters were not contentious. It did not err in failing to address them. Consequently, the applicant is not now entitled to assert or cannot succeed in asserting that the Tribunal erred in law by failing to do so."

While it is not necessary to show that the aggrieved person in fact has a case against the relevant person in order to obtain an interim injunction, the strength of the case is important. If the investigation is in its early stages it may be enough to show a possible case against the relevant person or the person on whose behalf the relevant person holds property.

Case21983,referred to,Barclays Bank v Tom [1922] 1 KB 221,"Before the various cross-respondents made their applications for leave to defend the applicants' claim against Landmark there was a good deal to be said in favour of the applicants' application. I acknowledge that even at that time there were reasons not to order separate trials. They were the matters often present in cases involving third party proceedings such as the desirability of having all parties bound by the decision between the plaintiff and the defendant so as to avoid the possibility of inconsistent findings, the additional cost and expense of two trials and the disadvantages to a defendant in two trials including possibly having to satisfy a judgment in favour of the plaintiff well before his claim against the third party is determined: Barclays Bank v Tom [1922] 1 KB 221; New World Oil and Developments Pty Limited v 163 Clarence Street Pty Limited [1995] FCA 138. However, in this case there were a number of weighty considerations on the other side. First, there was a large number of factual issues raised on the various cross-claims all of which at that point appeared to be of no relevance to the applicants' claim against Landmark. That was so because the proportionate liability provisions as properly construed appeared to be irrelevant because there was little to indicate at that time to suggest that any of the cross-respondents were directly liable to the applicants. Secondly, the applicants' claim against Landmark was a good deal more advanced in terms of being ready for trial than were any of the cross-claims. Thirdly, the applicants' difficult financial situation was relevant as was the fact that, if liability was established, that had been brought about by Landmark's conduct. 81 In addition, I refer to, without setting out, the observation of Scrutton LJ in Barclays Bank v Tom [1922] 1 KB 221 at 224."

Case3823,applied,D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397,"The question whether leave to appeal should be granted falls to be determined according to the criteria set down by the Full Court in D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397. First, whether the impugned decision is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. Secondly, whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the impugned decision was wrong. 21 The applicant, by his submissions, contends that: ""9. ... The proposition that [the second respondent] and/or Mr Ariss could have been expected to contend for, if present before the [Federal Magistrates] Court, namely, that they or one of them was the true owner of the jewellery, was clearly articulated as was the basis upon which they might seek to rely to establish such a claim: (a) there was express disclosure that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; (b) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt gave evidence that when she asked her husband (ie, Mr Ariss) for the jewellery, he said the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] and that she could not have it; (c) there was express disclosure that when the husband had been examined pursuant to s81 of the Bankruptcy Act , he asserted that he had given certain items of the jewellery to one or both of this daughters, consistent with ownership of the jewellery by him or [the second respondent]; (d) there was express disclosure that the bankrupt expressed the opinion that some of the house contents, the subject of the same policy of insurance, might be owned by [the second respondent] although, like the jewellery, such items of contents were not disclosed as an asset in the balance sheet of [the second respondent]. 10. In order to determine whether or not there was 'material' non-disclosure, it is necessary to have regard to the evidence of the bankrupt as a whole. It is asserted that the fact she had earlier given evidence contrary to the proposition the jewellery was hers was not disclosed. What the transcript of the evidence given by the bankrupt on 22 December 2005 discloses is that she did on occasion give contrary evidence. That is, on occasion she gave evidence that she thought that the jewellery was either that of Mr Ariss or [the second respondent]. However, what is critical is that she was examined as to why she might hold to that view. She said in evidence that she held that view for two reasons, namely: (a) because those persons were named as insureds in relation to the jewellery; and (b) her husband had told her that the jewellery was the property of [the second respondent] or of himself. Both considerations which had led [the bankrupt] to on occasion state that the jewellery might be the property of [the second respondent] or of Mr Ariss were disclosed on the ex parte application, as was the fact there was evidence consistent with such potential claims. 11. The cases establish that, on an application made ex parte, there must be disclosure of material facts. The material facts which were required to be disclosed here were: (a) that [the second respondent] and Mr Ariss were persons who were named as persons having an insured interest in relation to the jewellery. This was disclosed in the King ... affidavit and the relevant insurance documents were exhibited; (b) that Mr Ariss, currently the sole director of [the second respondent], held the view that the jewellery in question was either his or [the second respondent's]. This was also disclosed. 12. The best evidence that Mr Ariss and/or [the second respondent] would claim to be the owners of the jewellery, and the basis of that claim, was before the Federal Magistrates Court. There was direct evidence, of which the Court was informed, that Mr Ariss asserted the jewellery was his or [the second respondent's] and, on that basis, refused to return it to his wife. In those circumstances, the fact there was additional evidence from the bankrupt that, on the basis of the insureds' interest and on the basis of what her husband told her, she believed that the jewellery may be his or [the second respondent's] jewellery, was not material. ... ... 17. The King ... affidavit disclosed that [the second respondent] or Mr Ariss would assert an entitlement to the jewellery. The ... Magistrate knew that was the case they would make and knew there was documentary evidence in support of that case, at least as to an arguable insurable interest, notwithstanding none of the jewellery appeared on the balance sheet of [the second respondent]."" 28 The Magistrate's decision is not attended with sufficient doubt to warrant its reconsideration. I do not think it necessary to go on to consider whether substantial injustice would result if leave were not granted, supposing that the Magistrate's decision was wrong. The two limbs of the test in D&eacute;cor Corporation cannot be considered in isolation from one another: see D&eacute;cor Corporation at 398-399. The prospect that an appeal, if leave were granted, would be successful is so remote that it would be artificial to suppose that the decision below is wrong.

Case10900,related,Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001,"The following issues do not appear to be in contention: 1. The applicants in their written submissions conceded the general principle that costs follow the event, and that subject to consideration of a number of issues the applicants are not in a position to argue against an order that they pay the respondents' costs in these proceedings, including reserved costs. 2. On 4 August 2006 I made orders determining two notices of motion, one brought by each party, concerning further disclosure ( Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 2) [2006] FCA 1001). Each party had success on its motion. I reserved the costs of both notices of motion, and the applicants submit that no costs order should be made on either notice of motion. This approach is not contested by the respondents, and I propose to adopt it. 3. In relation to the hearings of 6 and 9 November 2006: &#8226; On 6 November 2006 I made directions to facilitate the bringing of an application for security for costs by the respondents, and reserved the costs of that directions hearing. &#8226; On 9 November 2006 I dismissed the application for security for costs brought by the respondents, and ordered that costs be reserved: Citrus Queensland Pty Ltd v Sunstate Orchards Pty Ltd (No 3) [2006] FCA 1498. &#8226; The applicants submitted that the security for costs application was a discrete application lost by the respondents and that they should have the costs of the directions hearing on 6 November and the costs of the application for security for costs having regard to the order of 9 November 2006. This submission is not contested by the respondents in their written submissions. I accept the submissions of the applicants and order that the costs of the applicants of the hearings of 6 November 2006 and 9 November 2006 be paid by the first and second respondents on a party to party basis. 4. In their written submissions the applicants also conceded that they were not in a position to resist an order that they pay the respondents' costs for the remaining interlocutory hearings, with the exception of costs associated with orders made on 18 July 2006 and 21 July 2006.

Case23761,followed,Toll (FCGT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165,"The deed poll is not, in itself, a contract between legal persons. But it is a commercial document intended to be the foundation of a contractual relationship embodied in the notes when issued. The ordinary principles of construction of contracts should be applied to the provisions of the deed poll, as well as to the transaction overall. These principles require the rights of the parties to be determined objectively, without reference to their subjective beliefs or understandings about what rights or liabilities would govern their relationship. What matters is what each party, by words and conduct, would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe. In this context, the role of the Court is to ascertain the common intention of the parties in the commercial matrix in which they contracted. This process involves discerning, in context, what a reasonable person would understand from the language in which the parties expressed their agreement, having regard to the objective surrounding circumstances with the purpose and the object of a transaction: Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ.

Case17001,cited,Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd [1986] 1 AC 965,"It is unnecessary and irrelevant to distinguish, in the present context, between a court that admits persons to practise as solicitors or barristers or both, and has an inherent disciplinary jurisdiction over persons so admitted as its officers, on the one hand, and a statutory court such as this Court on the other hand. In De Sousa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1993) 41 FCR 544, a case that pre-dated O 62 r 9(1) of the FC Rules in its present form, French J held that s 43 alone empowered the court to make a costs order against a solicitor. His Honour said that the Court's power to do so was to be seen as part of a wider power under the section to make a costs order against non-parties generally, and referred to Aiden Shipping Co Ltd v Interbulk Ltd [1986] 1 AC 965 (' Aiden ') and Knight v FP Special Assets Ltd [1992] HCA 28 ; (1992) 174 CLR 178 ( 'Knight' ).

Case21099,cited,Lovett on behalf of the Gunditjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474,"Lovett on behalf of the Gunditjmara People v State of Victoria [2007] FCA 474 the issue was addressed thus: ... There is a question as to how far a State party is required to investigate in order to satisfy itself of a credible basis for an application. One reason for the often inordinate time taken to resolve some of these cases is the overly demanding nature of the investigation conducted by State parties. The scope of these investigations demanded by some States is reflected in the complex connection guidelines published by some States. The power conferred by the Act on the Court to approve agreements is given in order to avoid lengthy hearings before the Court. The Act does not intend to substitute a trial, in effect, conducted by State parties for a trial before the Court. Thus, something significantly less than the material necessary to justify a judicial determination is sufficient to satisfy a State party of a credible basis for an application. As a result of my recurring concern with the undue burden placed upon applicants in cases resulting in consent determinations, I wrote to the parties prior to the hearing raising this concern in relation to the volume of material provided by the applicants in the present case. The State responded with a helpful and constructive submission which explained first, that in the recent Central Desert application filed by the Birriliburu People, the report provided by the representative body was short and targeted, and was used as a model report at the connection workshop conducted by the State at the end of 2008, and second, that the detail of the report in this case was provided by the applicants as a matter of their choice. It is to be hoped that the State will give careful consideration in future matters under s 87 and s 87A to easing the present unnecessary burden either placed on or assumed by native title applicants. On the material before the Court it is clearly appropriate to make the orders and the determination sought by the parties. It is now necessary to consider the proposed determination that the Nyangumarta Warrarn Aboriginal Corporation (the Corporation) be the trustee of the native title. Section 56 of the Act relevantly provides: Trust determination (1) One of the determinations that the Federal Court must make is whether the native title is to be held in trust, and, if so, by whom. Steps in making determination (2) The Federal Court is to take the following steps in making the determination: (a) first, it must request a representative of the persons it proposes to include in the determination of native title as the native title holders (the common law holders ) to indicate whether the common law holders intend to have the native title held in trust by: (i) nominating, in writing given to the Federal Court within a specified period, a prescribed body corporate to be trustee of the native title; and (ii) including with the nomination the written consent of the body corporate; and (b) secondly, if the common law holders give the nomination within the period, the Federal Court must determine that the prescribed body corporate is to hold the rights and interests from time to time comprising the native title in trust for the common law holders; and (c) thirdly, if the common law holders do not give the nomination within the period, the Federal Court must determine that the rights and interests are to be held by the common law holders. Native title held in trust (3) On the making of a determination under paragraph (2)(b), the prescribed body corporate holds, in accordance with the regulations, the rights and interests from time to time comprising the native title in trust for the common law holders. One of Mr Matthews' affidavits proves that the Corporation was registered under the Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006 (Cth) on 11 March 2009 and was thus a prescribed body corporate for the purposes of ss 56(2) and (3) (see reg 4(1) of the Native Title (Prescribed Bodies Corporate) Regulations 1999 (Cth) (the Regulations). Section 56(3) of the Act requires that the Corporation holds the native title rights and interests in accordance with the Regulations. I am satisfied that this is so. The rule book of the Corporation was tendered in evidence and rule 5.2.2 satisfies the requirement of reg 4(2)(a), rule 3(c)(i) satisfies the requirement of reg 4(2)(b), and rules 3(c)(i) and (ii) satisfy the requirements of reg 6(1). The Nyangumarta People filed a written nomination of the Corporation on 22 May 2009 in accordance with s 56(2)(a)(i) of the Act. The Corporation consented to the nomination and filed a written consent dated 22 May 2009 in accordance with s 56(2)(a)(ii) of the Act."
Case4500,cited,Re Schofield and Comcare (1995) 38 ALD 124,"The applicant acknowledges that there is no false and wilful misrepresentation to the effect that he did not suffer, and had not previously suffered from, a degenerative condition in his left knee. That is the disease specifically which the Tribunal found had been aggravated by the respondent's employment with the applicant. The respondent's evidence was that he had previously had trouble with his left knee in 2002 when he had been learning to drive a truck with a heavy clutch, but that the problem had resolved following physiotherapy. It was not contended by the applicant that that circumstance was sufficient to have obliged the respondent by reason of s 10(7) to have disclosed specifically the previously degenerative condition of his left knee because it is now shown that he was aware of it. It is not a circumstance where the respondent failed to disclose a symptom of a disease in the left knee in circumstances where it ought to have been disclosed, as distinct from the suffering of a particular and temporary injury: cf Re Schofield and Comcare (1995) 38 ALD 124. 70 The medical evidence indicated that the respondent had an underlying degenerative condition of both his knees, but does not firmly indicate that those degenerative conditions were related, or that the incapacity caused by aggravation of the degenerative condition in the left knee was related to the degenerative condition in the right knee. Reference need only be made to the report of Dr Bauze of 12 September 2005 and of the respondent's general practitioner, Dr Chambers, in his report of 19 October 2005 discussed in the Tribunal's reasons. 71 The applicant submitted that ""the relationship between degenerative conditions in knees is hardly controversial"". That may or may not be correct as a matter of general medical science, but it does not address the particular findings of fact, or the particular evidence in this case. As its contentions indicate, there was some medical evidence considering the relationship between the degenerative conditions of the respondent's right knee and his left knee. The issue was not fully explored because, in the particular circumstances, it was not a matter upon which the Tribunal was required to make, or made, a finding favourable to the contention of the applicant. It merely found that the respondent had a degenerative condition of his left knee which had been aggravated by his employment with the applicant, leading to incapacity for work. That state of the evidence does not enable me to make any finding on the issue, as potentially authorised by s 44(7) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth). 72 In those circumstances, in my judgment, the applicant has not shown in any event that the respondent made a wilful and false representation that he did not suffer, or had not previously suffered, from a degenerative condition in his left knee or had not suffered and did not suffer from the aggravation of that condition when he applied for his CMF or subsequently. In this particular case, the Tribunal did not make the finding upon which the applicant's contention is premised and in fact did not find that the degenerative conditions in the applicant's right and left knees were a single ailment, and should therefore be treated as a single disease. It made a different finding. The finding was open to it. 73 Consequently, the condition upon which s 10(7) would operate as a matter of fact to disentitle the applicant from compensation under the Seafarers Act has not been shown by the applicant to have been made out, and indeed its premise is inconsistent with the finding which the Tribunal in fact made."
Case21130,referred to,Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389,"Honour observed at [24] that it was common ground that the phrase 'juices of fruits' does not have a trade meaning. At [36] he referred to what was said by a Full Court of this Court in Zeroz Pty Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1997) 35 ATR 349 at 357, 'if there is no trade usage then a fortiori the expression must be used in its ordinary English sense'. But P &amp; N in that case, like the applicant in this case, made a number of submissions which, at the risk of doing the applicant a disservice, went something like this: (1) While the phrase 'juices of fruits' does not have a trade meaning, the phrase is synonymous with 'fruit juice' and that term had a trade meaning as defined in the Food Standards Code . (The Food Standards Code is a reference to the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code as defined in the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991 (Cth). The Food Standards Code , standard 2.6.1, with respect to fruit juice and vegetable juice, defined fruit juice or vegetable juice as the liquid portion, with or without pulp, obtained from fruit or vegetables respectively and in the case of citrus fruit, other than lime, the endocarp only of the fruit and included products that had been concentrated and later reconstituted with water to a concentration consistent with that of the undiluted juice from which it had been made. At [21] and [22], his Honour observed that it was common ground that the fruit drinks supplied by P &amp; N met the Food Standards Code requirements. It was also common ground that P &amp; N fruit drinks contained non-fruit based additives, vitamins and minerals or used processing aids within the limits permitted by the Food Standards Code . The evidence was that the fruit drinks contained 98% - 99% fruit juice and 1% - 2% additives and processing aids not directly derived from fruit.) (2) In substituting a trade meaning of 'fruit juice' for 'juices of fruits' that has no trade meaning, reliance was placed on Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 where the phrase 'silver dye bleach reversal process' in a tariff concession had no trade meaning but the words 'silver dye bleach process' did. The High Court held that the Tribunal's construction of the composite phrase by reference to the trade meaning of the lesser phrase and the ordinary meaning of the word 'reversal', involved no error of law. The submission, by parity of reasoning, was that in the Item 11 composite phrase 'wholly of juices of fruits', the word 'wholly' should be given its ordinary meaning and the words 'juices of fruits' (in both Items 11 and 12) should be given the trade meaning for 'fruit juice'. (3) That having adopted the Foods Standards Code prior to the introduction of the GST Act, its concepts were well known to the Parliament and that it may be taken to have had regard to them in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food. As to the reliance on Agfa-Gevaert in substituting a trade meaning of 'fruit juice' for 'juices of fruits', his Honour said at [27]: Agfa-Gevaert is quite different from the instant circumstances. The composite phrase was not one that had an obvious ordinary meaning. Nor did the lesser phrase. In those circumstances, the lesser [phrase] aided the proper interpretation of the composite one. Here, the words that comprise the composite phrase are words of common parlance, even if they are oddly arranged, and there is not the same need to call in aid a trade meaning. As to the submission that Parliament may be taken to have adopted the Food Standards Code and its trade meaning of 'fruit juice' in respect of a law dealing with the exemption of food, his Honour said at [34] [35]: [34] ... Furthermore, the extrinsic materials do not suggest that parliament adopted a trade meaning in the Foods Standards Code . If it had, one would have expected it to have departed from the unusual [phrase] ""juices of fruits"". The extrinsic material makes it clear, in my view, that parliament intended to bring within the scope of the amendments to the GST Act the exemptions or concessions in relation to food products under the existing sales tax legislation. Hence the adoption of the phraseology in Item 11. [35] Parliament was invoking its past legislation rather than adopting a trade meaning of other words in an industry code that the past legislation preceded. The harking back to a phrase used in the sales tax legislation in 1935 leads to the irresistible conclusion that parliament was carrying forward some of the exemptions and concessions with respect to food in the sales tax legislation and not attributing to the phrase any trade meaning of a different term in the Foods Standards Code . There was no logical reason for parliament, in introducing a new tax, to adopt a code intended to ensure that the public was protected from poorly prepared food. The 2 objects are clearly distinct. If parliament had intended to adopt the code, one would have expected a collocation such as: ""non-alcoholic carbonated beverages produced wholly in accordance with the Foods Standards Code "".

Case15425,cited,TelePacific Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85,"The Tribunal has an obligation to give reasons that make it possible to understand its reasoning process. Failure to do so is an error of law ( Lang v Comcare (2007) 94 ALD 141 at [54]-[55] per Stone J citing TelePacific Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (2005) 218 ALR 85). This includes an obligation to give reasons for rejecting evidence that is plainly central to a party's claim and crucial to a medical report that supported that claim ( Lang at [54] per Stone J). As was pointed out by Stone J in Lang at [53] [55], the Tribunal is entitled to accept or reject the respective pieces of evidence before it or to accord certain pieces of evidence different weight. It is under no obligation to refer to all of the evidence before it. There is no obligation to make a finding on every question of fact that may be regarded as objectively material. The Tribunal is entitled to refer to all the medical reports, as Mr Sellick says the Tribunal did and to accept and reject evidence as it sees fit. The Tribunal is entitled to reject medical evidence or simply to prefer contrary medical evidence. It is obliged, however, to include in its reasons findings on all material questions of fact. Where a failure to give reasons makes it impossible to understand the Tribunal's reasoning process, that is an error of law."

This impeded the proper conduct of the litigation, as Mr Armitage apparently concedes. Parties to litigation such as Mr Armitage are obliged to take steps to keep themselves informed of the conduct of the litigation by their appointed legal representatives. They cannot escape their responsibility as parties with respect to the conduct of the litigation by hiding behind a poorly instructed lawyer retained briefly or at the last minute.

His notice of appeal, which was filed on 24 February 2006, preceded the taxation hearings. 36 I am satisfied, however, that, taken as a whole, the circumstances are such as to justify me setting aside pars [2] and [3] the orders made on 3 February 2006: compare KM &amp; A Chadwick . 37 I would set aside par [3] of my orders principally because it was made in Mr Armitage's absence from the final stages of the hearing of Ms Wu's motion and costs application and will apparently operate to prevent Mr Armitage, who swears that he is impecunious, from advancing his defence. Having regard to the serious nature of some of the claims made against him and to the fact that he has apparently an arguable defence, it would not be in the interests of justice to make an order with such a result. That Ms Wu will suffer some inconvenience or hardship as a result is unavoidable. It is impossible to reconcile Ms Wu's interest in having the benefit of the orders previously with Mr Armitage's interest in having an opportunity to advance his defence. 38 For essentially the same reasons, I would also set aside par [2] of the 3 February orders. For the reasons set out below, I would order instead that, after judgment in this proceeding, Mr Armitage pay, on an indemnity basis, costs in the amount of $26,666.02 in respect of Ms Wu's motion. Further, I would order that Mr Armitage pay Ms Wu's costs of his motion. As will be seen below, although Mr Armitage has been partially successful in his motion, the need for such a motion arose from his failure to keep himself informed of the conduct of the proceeding on his behalf."
Case6950,referred to,JB Williams Company v H Bronnley &amp; Co Limited (1909) 26 RPC 765,"In Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 514H-515C Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said that a trader could only claim protection for such capricious additions to a commonly used container as distinguished his use of that container from the use of other traders. Thus, the trader may prevent a rival copying the label on boxes or perhaps the distinctive combination of colours on tins but cannot stop the rival using ordinary boxes or tins simply because they happen to be the same shape and size as his. He said that it was not the shape and size of the container which identified the product of a particular trader to the public, but the capricious additions to it by way of distinctive labelling or a combination of colour or graphic design. He referred to JB Williams Company v H Bronnley &amp; Co Limited (1909) 26 RPC 765 at 771 per Cozens-Hardy MR and at 774 per Farwell LJ. In that case, at 773, Fletcher Moulton LJ had said there that the get-up of an article meant a capricious addition to the article itself, such as the colour or shape or wrapper or anything of that kind: see too Doctor Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holdings Pty Ltd (1999) 44 IPR 281 at 369 [339] per Goldberg J; and Borden [1990] 1 WLR at 515C-D per Lord Jauncey."
Case3914,cited,Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1,"There is high authority against the supposed limitation on the exercise of the discretionary power to grant declaratory relief. In Sankey v Whitlam [1978] HCA 43 ; (1978) 142 CLR 1 the High Court, in respect of then current committal proceedings (ie actual, not hypothetical, criminal proceedings) made declarations that (i) certain documents were privileged from production and that (ii) the information laid against Mr Whitlam was bad in law. Gibbs ACJ said at 20-21: ""It is well established that the power of the court to make a declaration, under a provision such as s 75 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (N.S.W.), as amended, or O. 26, r. 19 of the Rules of this Court, is a very wide one: Forster v. Jododex Aust. Pty. Ltd . [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421, at pp 435-436 . It is clear enough that the power of the court is not excluded because the matter as to which a declaration is sought may fall for decision in criminal proceedings. Indeed in Dyson v. Attorney-General [1911] 1 KB 410, which is one of the foundations of the law on this subject, it was held that the court had power to make a declaration that the plaintiff was not under any obligation to comply with the requisitions contained in a notice sent to him by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, notwithstanding that neglect to comply with the notice was an offence see especially per Farwell L.J. [1911]1 KB, at p 422. Since that time there have been many cases in which the courts have made declarations in relation to questions which could have fallen for decision in criminal proceedings."" 57 His Honour observed (at 603) that while ordinarily a declaration is not made that a defendant has committed a crime, there was no doubt that there was jurisdiction to make such a declaration in a proper case: Imperial Tobacco Limited v Attorney-General [1981] AC 718 at 750, Sankey v Whitlam . Thus it was appropriate in many cases for a business person who is told by a regulatory authority that he or she cannot do something to apply for a declaration that the view is erroneous. Conversely, the right was mutual; the Crown could also obtain a declaration that the person's conduct contravened the law. That practice, which was common in New South Wales, had been given the ""seal of approval"" by the High Court in Australian Softwood ."
Case5735,applied,Preston v Star City Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 1273,"Moreover, in Preston v Star City Pty Ltd [1999] NSWSC 1273 at [87] , Wood CJ in Common Law referred to the Street Report to support the view that the requisite legislative intention to confer a private right of action was not to be found in the Casino Control Act . 99 Preston was not concerned with a breach of s 85 of the Casino Control Act , which was pleaded in the present case. Nevertheless, his Honour's remarks at [87] were directed at the establishment of the regulatory scheme as a whole. He said that the Street Report and the Second Reading Speech point towards ""the establishment of the regulatory scheme as the means of addressing the negative aspects of legalised gambling."" He continued by saying: ""There is nothing in that material, or in the Act itself, to suggest that there should be a private right of action additional to the obligations imposed upon casino operators."""
Case12145,cited,Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1990] HCA 31 ; (1990) 170 CLR 70,"In any event, where the basis for the alleged apprehension of bias applies to all judges of the Court, the doctrine of necessity applies so that a judge of this Court has to hear the application. The doctrine of necessity permits a member of a court who has some interest in the subject matter of the litigation to sit on a case where no judge without such an interest is available to sit ( Laws v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal [1990] HCA 31 ; (1990) 170 CLR 70 per Mason CJ and Brennan J at 88). 15 Accordingly, this application for recusal is refused. 16 After I determined that I would not recuse myself on the ground of bias and/ or reasonable apprehension of bias, Mr Priestley seeks to raise an additional ground as to why I should recuse myself, namely, my role as a rule making judge of this Court."

Findings of fact based on an assessment of credit that is itself open on the material or has some rational basis are not reviewable by the court: Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 558-9.
Case8219,cited,GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1,"Although the phrase ""carries on a business"" appears in a number of provisions of the TPA including s 2B, it is not defined in the Act. However it has received consideration by Courts to the extent that a number of principles have emerged which are of relevance in this case. They are as follows: 1. ""Business"" in the context of s 2B is normally a ""wide and general"" word: Gibbs CJ in Actors and Announcers Equity Association of Australia v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; (1982) 150 CLR 169 at 184, McHugh ACJ, Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ in NT Power 219 CLR at 116. Its meaning in the TPA is widened by s 4(1), since ""business"" includes ""a business not carried on for profit"": NT Power 219 CLR at 116. 2. The phrase ""carries on a business"" should be interpreted in light of the purpose of Parliament in introducing s 2B and related legislation, which was to ensure that ""with state and territory application legislation, the prohibitions against anti-competitive conduct can be applied to all businesses in Australia."" (Australia, House of Representatives, Parliamentary Debates (Hansard) 30 June 1995, p 2794). 3. Subject to a statutory qualification as to not for profit businesses, in the context of the TPA, ""carrying on a business"" is intended to refer to activities undertaken in a commercial enterprise or as a going concern: GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 50 ; (2003) 128 FCR 1 at 303, Corrections Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [2000] FCA 1280 ; (2000) 104 FCR 448 at 451. 4. An act of government, whether directly or through an authority, which is merely the carrying out of the functions of government in the performance of its statutory duty, is unlikely to be characterised as ""carrying on a business"": Village Building Company Limited v Canberra International Airport Pty Limited (No 2) [2004] FCA 133 at [90] . So, for example, the issue of certificates by a municipal council with respect to a real property pursuant to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) was not ""carrying on a business"" ( Mid Density Development Pty Ltd v Rockdale Municipal Council (1992) 39 FCR 579), nor was operating a detention centre ( Corrections Corporation of Australia [2000] FCA 1280 ; 104 FCR 448), nor were the activities of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in acquiring cattle in endeavours to eradicate Bovine Johne's Disease, providing compensation to farmers for cattle slaughter, and reselling the carcases to recoup some of the funds: State of New South Wales v RT &amp; YE Falls Investments Pty Ltd [2003] NSWCA 54 ; (2003) 57 NSWLR 1. However, activities for reward which are those which could be performed by any citizen or private trader potentially constitutes ""carrying on a business"". Examples of this are Paramedical Services Pty Ltd v The Ambulance Service of New South Wales [1999] FCA 548 where the Ambulance Service of New South Wales supplied, for reward, ambulance services at sporting events and first aid training, and JS McMillan v Commonwealth (1997) 77 FCR 337 where the Commonwealth in its guise as AGPS provided general printing services, dispatch and distribution services, graphic design services and editorial services. 5. Mere repetitiveness is not sufficient to constitute carrying on of a business; further, although system and regularity are involved in the carrying on of the business it does not necessarily follow that one who has transactions of the same kind systematically or regularly is carrying on a business in those transactions: JS McMillan 77 FCR at 354, GEC Marconi Systems 128 FCR at 303, Sirway Asia Pacific Pty Ltd v Commonwealth of Australia [2002] FCA 1152 at [53] ."
Case12283,cited,Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24,"I have proceeded upon the basis that greenhouse gas emissions consequent upon the burning of coal mined in one of these projects might arguably cause an impact upon a protected matter, which impact could be said to be an impact of the proposed action. I have adopted this approach because it appears to have been the approach adopted by Mr Flanigan. However I am far from satisfied that the burning of coal at some unidentified place in the world, the production of greenhouse gases from such combustion, its contribution towards global warming and the impact of global warming upon a protected matter, can be so described. The applicant's concern is the possibility that at some unspecified future time, protected matters in Australia will be adversely and significantly affected by climate change of unidentified magnitude, such climate change having been caused by levels of greenhouse gases (derived from all sources) in the atmosphere. There has been no suggestion that the mining, transportation or burning of coal from either proposed mine would directly affect any such protected matter, nor was there any attempt to identify the extent (if any) to which emissions from such mining, transportation and burning might aggravate the greenhouse gas problem. The applicant's case is really based upon the assertion that greenhouse gas emission is bad, and that the Australian government should do whatever it can to stop it including, one assumes, banning new coal mines in Australia. This case is far removed from the factual situation in Minister for Environment and Heritage v Queensland Conservation Council Inc [2004] FCAFC 190 ; (2004) 139 FCR 24. 73 In the circumstances the application must be dismissed. I will hear submissions as to costs. I certify that the preceding seventy-three (73) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett.

Case20336,followed,Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397,"No point has been taken by the appellant as to the late filing of this Notice and, in light of the first respondent's attitude to the procedural defect identified in the Notice, no point of substance arises from the late filing of that Notice. As I have said, leave to appeal is required (see Decor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc [1991] FCA 655 ; (1991) 33 FCR 397). In order to secure leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment, an applicant must show that there is sufficient doubt as to the correctness of the judgment below to warrant review and, further, that, if the judgment below is found to be wrong, substantial injustice would be suffered by the applicant if leave to appeal were refused. 4 I will continue to refer to the appellant as ""the appellant"" notwithstanding the fact that I propose to deal with the matter upon the basis that the process filed constitutes an application for leave to appeal. Ms Weston, on behalf of the first respondent, accepts that I should approach the matter on the basis that the process filed is an application for leave to appeal from the Federal Magistrate's decision and I intend to deal with the matter on that basis. 5 The appellant is a citizen of China who arrived in Australia on 11 November 2007. On 4 December 2007 the appellant lodged an application for a protection visa with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. A delegate of the first respondent refused that application on 16 January 2008. On 31 January 2008 the appellant applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision. 6 In the proceedings before the Tribunal the appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of her practice of Falun Gong. She claimed before the Tribunal that she was introduced to Falun Gong in 2000, though she later stated she had been introduced to Falun Gong in 1997 by a customer in the shop where she worked. She said that in 2007 she was practising Falun Gong at a friend's house and that the police came and arrested them. She claimed that she had been detained for five days during which time she was tortured. She said that she was released when her husband paid a large sum of money, presumably to the authorities. 7 The Tribunal found that the appellant was not a credible witness. The Tribunal found that the appellant's evidence was inconsistent, implausible and confused and noted that in many instances she was not frank or forthcoming in the answers she gave."
Case16723,followed,"Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 , 101 FCR 71","The Bankruptcy Act , it must nevertheless be accepted, confers no entitlement to trial by jury: Hubner v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd [1999] FCA 385 , 88 FCR 445. Cooper, Kiefel and Tamberlin JJ were there addressing s 30(3) of the 1966 Act, and not s 30(1)(i), but relevantly concluded: Jury [27] Mr and Mrs Hubner also say that the bankruptcy proceedings should be heard with a jury pursuant to s30(3) of the Act. That provision reads: ""(3) If in a proceeding before the Court under this Act a question of fact arises that a party desires to have trial before a jury, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the trial to that question to be had before a jury, and the trial may be had accordingly in the same manner as if it were the trail of an issue of fact in an action."" [28] The appellants say that it is a civil right of all Queenslanders to have a trial by jury under s30(3). [29] In view of the approach taken by his Honour, which we consider to be correct, the question of a jury trial does not arise; so we do not accept the applicants' submissions in relation to this matter. Moreover, there was no relevant question of fact raised for a jury to determine. The Court under s30(3) has a wide discretion and there is no entitlement to a jury trial given by the section. We are not persuaded, given the necessity for a clear case of error to be shown on a matter of principle that there is any justification for ordering a jury trial in the present case. We see no error on the part of his Honour. Section 30(3) is not beyond the legislative competence of Commonwealth Parliament and is not invalid because of any unfounded assertion that it "" undermines or perverts "" the Constitution : Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Heinrich [2000] FCA 1255 at [18] [25] per Mansfield J. Nor is there any entitlement to trial by jury arising by reason of either some "" unwritten law "" such as natural justice or by reason of Schedule 2 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth): Hubner v ANZ Banking Group Ltd [2000] FCA 140 at [9] [10], [2000] FCA 140 ; 101 FCR 71 at 73 per Drummond, Dowsett and Katz JJ."

Only the first is relevant to the present case. It is where there is a bona fide omission by cross-examining counsel to deal with the subject and the omission comes to the cross-examiner's attention shortly after the witness has left the witness box. I do not consider that his Honour was attempting to lay down an exhaustive list. Rather, he set out guiding factors for the exercise of the discretion in situations which may be thought commonly to arise."

The first of those four proceedings, being numbered NSD 539 of 2004 and involving IEL Finance Limited as applicant, was treated by the parties as the precedent vehicle, for the most part, for implementation of orders to be made in the remaining three proceedings. The abbreviations adopted in these reasons reflect those used in the preceding principal reasons for judgment of 21 March 2006. There appears to be no controversy between the relevant parties regarding the content of the first order to be made in all four proceedings brought of course at the instance of the applicable applicant. Nor is there controversy as to consequential orders numbered 4 to 7 concerning grant of leave to the applicant in all four proceedings to file the amended pleading and to the Commissioner filing a subsequent reply. Where controversy lies is in relation to the nature and scope of the order required to give effective operation as to the implications of the strike-out of the foregoing paragraphs of amended statement of facts, issues and contentions (the proposed order 2) and to the order to be made as to costs of this motion and of the application for summary judgment (the proposed order 3). As to what version of Order 3 as to costs should be made, the Commissioner pointed out that IEF had made no submissions at the hearing in relation to the Commissioner's claim that '[t]he applicant pay the respondent's (ie Commissioners) costs of this motion and of the application', nor led evidence concerning the need to apportion costs incurred by the respondent between issues of additional and primary tax'. The Commissioner referred to [130] of my reasons for judgment where I held that the '[t] he Commissioner must have the costs of the proceedings to date, inclusive of the costs related to the present summary application' , and submitted that the text of the orders now sought should 'reflect that finding precisely' . I think that the Commissioner's submission is correct and reflects the substance of the outcome and the implications of my principal findings made earlier on 21 March 2006 in the IEL Finance principal proceedings ( ante ). Accordingly I have made the orders in each proceedings essentially as proposed by the Commissioner.

Case4842,followed,VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158,"As the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal are relevant to decide whether leave to appeal should be granted (see VUAX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] - [48] ), it is appropriate first to address the proposed grounds of appeal to assess their merits. Realistically, as counsel for the first respondent acknowledged, if those grounds of appeal are likely to result in success on the appeal and the quashing of the decision of the Tribunal, given the significant implications to the appellant of the present decision of the Tribunal which would have him return to Bangladesh, there would be strong reason to allow the proposed grounds of appeal to be pursued: cf SZAIX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 3 at [66] ; NAJT v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 ; (2005) 147 FCR 51."
Case7549,considered,Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24,"In support of these submissions, Mr Bryant pointed to observations by Mason J (as he then was) in Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24 at 41 to the effect that a court may set aside an administrative decision that has failed to give adequate weight to a relevant factor of great importance, or has given excessive weight to a relevant factor of no great importance, on the ground that the decision is manifestly unreasonable. It was also noted, by reference to Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Swift and Ors (1989) 18 ALD 679 and Riddle v Telstra Corporation Limited [2006] FCA 58 ; (2006) 149 FCR 348 , that these principles apply equally to a decision of the Tribunal."
Case15436,cited,Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brown [1999] FCA 1198 ; 99 ATC 4852 ,"Commissioner's opposition to the grant of an extension of time for the applicant to file a notice of appeal from the decision of the Tribunal was mainly, indeed wholly, grounded on the principle in (5), namely, the merits of the applicant's proposed appeal. In submissions, the Commissioner referred to the fact that in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Brown [1999] FCA 1198 ; 99 ATC 4852 at [12] a Full Court of this Court referred to that matter as an 'important consideration'; an applicant should show that he or she has an 'arguable case' to warrant an extension of time: Brown , at first instance [1999] FCA 563 ; , 99 ATC 4516 at [56] per Hill J, accepting the view of von Doussa J in Windshuttle v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1993] FCA 553 ; (1993) 46 FCR 235 at 243."
Case20121,cited,SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034,"The First Respondent says that since the Appellant 'republished' the relevant information to the Tribunal for the purposes of the application before the Tribunal, the Tribunal acted in a way entirely consistent with the principles identified in the following decisions of the Full Court of the Federal Court; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Al Shamry [2001] FCA 919 ; (2001) 110 FCR 27; and SZEEU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 ; and the principles identified by the High Court in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162; and notions of 'republication', discussed in the following decisions of the Federal Court; SZDMJ v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1034 ; and SZHIB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCA 611."
Case6469,applied,Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Inc (1981) 148 CLR 170,"It is common ground that in ruling upon this application, the Court is to apply the test established by the High Court in Adam P. Brown Male Fashions Pty Ltd v Phillip Morris Inc (1981) 148 CLR 170 which requires the respondent to persuade the Court that the discharge of the undertaking would be appropriate because of the existence of new facts that render the ongoing enforcement of the undertaking unjust. 4 The respondent carries the burden of establishing the new facts. Mr McDonald of Senior Counsel, who appeared on behalf of the respondent with Mr O'Grady, argued that there were two material changes in circumstances which rendered it unjust for the Court to maintain the undertaking of the respondent. 5 First, Mr McDonald contended that the cause of action under s 1317AA of the Act had been abandoned by the legal representative of the applicant in the course of the trial, which is presently part heard. Reference was made to the transcript at pp 22 and 50 which support the contention that this cause of action was abandoned in the course of the trial."
Case19211,discussed,"The ""Looiersgracht"" [1995] 2 Lloyd's Rep 411","Francesco Berlingieri said that Art 3(2) in the 1952 Arrest Convention did not allow a sister ship to be arrested unless it was fully owned by the same person or persons who owned the ship in respect of which the claim arose: Berlingieri on Arrest of Ships (3 rd ed, 2000) at 112-113 [1.444] (4 th ed: 2006) at 159 [52.433]. And a similar conclusion was reached by Prothonatory Hargrave on the construction of s 43(8) of the Canadian Federal Courts Act which required the arrested ship to be ""beneficially owned"": The ""Looiersgracht"" [1995] 2 Lloyd's Rep 411 at 415."
Case21794,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-763,"Depending on the circumstances of the case, other principles may also be relevant. Where the relevant conduct gives rises to several contraventions of the TPA, it will be relevant to take into account the totality principle to ensure that the total penalty does not exceed what is proper for the entire contravening conduct in question: see Trade Practices Commission v Advance Bank Australia Ltd (1993) ATPR 41-229 ( 'Advance Bank' ) at 41,164 per Gummow J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) (2002) 190 ALR 169 ( 'ABB Transmission' ) at 179-180 [38]-[39]; TNT at 40,169. The parity principle, ie all other things being equal, similar conduct should be deserving of similar penalties, will have direct application where penalties are being imposed on several contravening respondents. The principle also draws attention, albeit less directly, to the penalties that have been imposed in past cases. There is, of course, a limit to the usefulness of any comparison with past penalties: the circumstances of particular cases are likely to differ in significant respects and each case must be considered by reference to its own circumstances: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v George Weston Foods Ltd (2000) ATPR 41-763 ( 'George Weston' ) at 40,984 [31] per Goldberg J. 51 I have already observed that the CEPU was aware that DJN performed work at Loy Yang B, that it did not have an EBA with the CEPU, and that the provision proposed by the CEPU for Edison's agreement would operate to exclude DJN from working at Loy Yang B so long as it did not enter into an EBA with the CEPU. Edison was also aware of these matters. As events transpired, DJN was the only electrical contractor affected by the arrangement over the period between August 2001 and December 2003. However, the impact of the arrangement was potentially wider than this. In my opinion, it is appropriate to have regard to the fact that the arrangement was general in terms, and that the exclusionary provision had the potential to prevent any electrical contractor being retained by Edison to perform work at Loy Yang B if the contractor did not obtain or maintain a current certified agreement with the CEPU. In Rural Press at 43,296 [46], Mansfield J pointed out that even in cases where the contravening conduct was not carried through to its conclusion and therefore no loss resulted, courts have taken into account the potential harm in determining the seriousness of the offence; see also George Weston and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cromford Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-618."
Case5839,cited,R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389,"The first respondent submits that even if there has been a breach of s 91R(3) , the Court should refuse relief in its discretion. There is merit in the submission. I am satisfied that the findings in respect to the appellant's conduct in China would, independently of the findings as to his conduct in Australia, support the Tribunal's conclusions on the question of persecution: R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; ex parte Ozone Theatres (Aust) Ltd [1949] HCA 33 ; (1949) 78 CLR 389 at 400; Stead v State Government Insurance Commission [1986] HCA 54 ; (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 145-6; Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte AALA [2000] FCA 57 ; (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [104] , [131] and [211]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 215 ALR 162 at [80] , [174] and [211]; see also SZBYR v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 26 ; (2007) 235 ALR 609 at [29] ."
Case12150,distinguished,Gilmour v AMP General Insurance (1997) 9 ANZIC 61-372 ,"MDRN seeks to narrow the construction of cl 5(e)(v) of the St Paul policy, submitting that it does not operate to deprive an innocent partner of indemnity where loss is the result of the dishonest or fraudulent act of an employee. The point is clearly unarguable. Clause 5(e)(v) specifically excludes indemnity where the loss occurs in those circumstances. The argument would result in the clause having no effect whatsoever. MDRN sought to rely upon the decision of the Full Court of South Australia in Gilmour v AMP General Insurance (1997) 9 ANZIC 61-372. However it is relatively clear that the case did not involve a clause such as cl 5(e)(v). There is nothing in this argument. 611. As I understand it, my findings lead to the conclusion that St Paul is obliged to indemnify MDRN only in the amount of Mr Bengston's claim. However I will invite the parties to make further submissions should they wish to do so. 612. One other matter requires comment. St Paul submits that the fees charged by Mr Jessup are not recoverable by the applicants. The applicants do not claim them as damages. However they were deducted from moneys received by Mr Jessup and so the amount thereof was not passed on to investors. The amount of each claim has been increased as a result of such deduction."
Case351,cited,Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 322 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280,"In Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 322 ; (1993) 43 FCR 280 , the Full Court of the Federal Court sought to identify from previous decisions what might amount to a question of law. That decision was considered by the High Court in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389. The Court said at 395: Some recent Federal Court decisions have attempted to distil the numerous authorities on the problem into a number of general propositions. Thus in Pozzolanic, after referring to many cases, the Court identified five general propositions: ""1. The question whether a word or phrase in a statute is to be given its ordinary meaning or some technical or other meaning is a question of law. 2. The ordinary meaning of a word or its non-legal technical meaning is a question of fact. 3. The meaning of a technical legal term is a question of law. 4. The effect or construction of a term whose meaning or interpretation is established is a question of law. 5. The question whether facts fully found fall within the provision of a statutory enactment properly construed is generally a question of law."" (Footnotes omitted.)"
Case10307,discussed,McGowan v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2003] FCA 482 ; (2003) 129 FCR 118,"The Commonwealth could not refer me to any case in which the Court has made an order under O 29 r 2 for the separate trial of the question whether declaratory relief should be refused as a matter of discretion, prior to any consideration of the merits of the claim for declaratory relief. It did, however, refer me to McGowan v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2003] FCA 482 ; (2003) 129 FCR 118 ( 'McGowan' ) which concerned the dismissal of a judicial review application. 67 In McGowan , the applicant sought judicial review of a decision by the Migration Agents Registration Authority to suspend her registration as a migration agent until she satisfied certain conditions. The applicant made an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under s 306 of the Migration Act for a merits review of the Authority's decision to suspend her registration some days before she instituted proceedings in the Federal Court seeking judicial review of the Authority's decision. The application was founded principally on the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 ( 'ADJR Act' ), but also relied in the alternative on s 39B(1A)(c) of the Judiciary Act . The relief sought by the applicant included an order pursuant to s 16(1) of the ADJR Act setting aside or quashing the Authority's decision, and in the alternative, orders by way of prohibition and injunction pursuant to s 39B."
Case16546,cited,Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning (Aust) Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947,"The degree of annexation test looks to the manner in which the object is attached to the land. If the object is attached to the land, other than by its own weight, there is a rebuttable presumption that it forms part of the land. The greater the degree of annexation, the stronger the presumption. If on the other hand, the object is attached only by its own weight, there is a rebuttable presumption that it is not part of the land, even if it has become embedded in the soil. In such a case the onus lies upon the person claiming that the object forms part of the land to prove that it was erected with the intention that it should become part of the land: Reid v Smith [1905] HCA 54 ; (1905) 3 CLR 656 at 668, 673-4, 675-6; Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd &amp; Ors v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning (Aust) Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947 at 950-1. The courts will infer the degree of annexation from the surrounding circumstances including the nature of the object and the nature of the interest held in the land by the owner of the object. The test is objective, namely, what a reasonable person would consider to be the reason for attaching the object to the land. 70 Further the proper formulation of the test is not whether damages are an adequate remedy but whether it is just in all the circumstances that the plaintiff should be confined to his remedy in damages. The courts have recognised there may be cases in which it is unjust to confine a plaintiff to its remedy in damages because of, for example, the difficulty in estimating damages and damages which cannot be taken into monetary account such as loss of goodwill and trade reputation: Belgrave Nominees Pty Ltd v Barlin-Scott Airconditioning Pty Ltd [1984] VR 947 at 954-5, citing Evans Marshall &amp; Co Ltd v Bertola SA and Sherry Imports Ltd [1973] 1 WLR 349."
Case3430,considered,"Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Laing (1998) 89 FCR 17 ","The conduct identified in paras (a) and (d) would, almost certainly, have been the conduct of employers or employees. However the conduct identified in paras (b) and (c) may have been the conduct of others. In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Laing (1998) 89 FCR 17 at 30-31, French J observed, concerning a similar provision in the WR Act: While par (a) of the definition relates to the ""performance of work"", par (b) is more broadly expressed. It refers to ""a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on the acceptance of or offering for work"". The central meaning of the term ""ban"" in the industrial, as in its ordinary usage, is to ""prohibit or interdict"": the Macquarie Dictionary. Communication between persons or an organization and persons is essential to a ""ban"". And while the notion of ""limitation"" or ""restriction"" may have a meaning related to manner of actual performance of work, that meaning is picked up in par (a) of the definition. Under par (b) it extends to the communication of a limitation or restriction. Communication picked up under pars (b) and (c) must no doubt purport to be at least hortatory, if not authoritative and binding, upon the person or persons to whom they are directed. In the ordinary course such communication will be verbal whether oral, written or in electronic form. Being intended to affect or affecting the performance of work, it is industrial action because of its instrumental character. Notwithstanding that it is communication it falls within the terms of the definition. 51 At 32, his Honour continued: So a picket line whose purpose is to prevent or deter or discourage employees from attending on their employer's premises and from carrying out their work could constitute a ban for the purposes of s 127."""
Case5066,referred to,Kazacos v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2007] FCA 1573 ,The approach to the construction of a provision of this kind was discussed in Kazacos v Migration Agents Registration Authority [2007] FCA 1573 at [4] . Neither party took exception to this approach.
Case255,cited,State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282,"The majority said, at [55]: The challenge to the validity of the legislation enacted in reliance on the corporations power does not put in issue directly the characteristics of corporations covered by s 51(xx). It does not call directly for an examination of what is a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. (Plainly, a foreign corporation is a corporation formed outside the limits of the Commonwealth.) No party or intervener called in question what was said about trading and financial corporations in R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte WA National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; [(1979) 143 CLR 190 ; 23 ALR 439] , Actors and Announcers Equity Association v Fontana Films Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 23 ; [(1982) 150 CLR 169 ; 40 ALR 609] , State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [(1982) [1982] HCA 72 ; 150 CLR 282 ; 44 ALR 1] or Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; [(1983) 152 CLR 570 ; 46 ALR 41]. 69 The submissions on behalf of the applicants in QUD 481 of 2006 refer to cases decided by the High Court that have considered the question of whether particular entities are trading or financial corporations: a football club in Adamson's case ; a statutory corporation generating and selling electricity in Commonwealth v State of Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 158 CLR 1 ( Tasmanian Dams case); a State Corporation conducting financial trading activities in order to finance and operate a superannuation scheme in State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 ; and a dormant shelf company which had not yet commenced to trade in any capacity in Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570. 72 Toohey J in Hughes summarised the position up until 1986, saying, at 20: The last few years have seen several decisions, particularly by the High Court, in which the notion of a trading corporation has been examined. It is not my intention to refer to those decisions in great detail but rather to state the principles that appear to emerge from them and then to apply those principles to the facts of the present case. 1. The mere fact that a corporation trades does not mean that it is a trading corporation: R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte St George County Council [1974] HCA 7 ; (1974) 130 CLR 533 at 543, 562 (St George County Council); R v Federal Court of Australia; Ex parte Western Australian National Football League [1979] HCA 6 ; (1979) 143 CLR 190 at 219, 234 (Adamson). 2. The purpose of incorporation, propounded in St George County Council, is no longer a valid test. The test is one of the current activities of the corporation: Adamson; State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 at 304; (1982) ATPR 40-326 at 43,976-43,977 (State Superannuation Board). 3. But the current activities test is not the sole criterion for determining whether a corporation is a trading corporation. Thus where a corporation has not begun to trade, its character may be found in its constitution. Even when there are current activities, the corporation's constitution is not completely irrelevant: Fencott v Muller [1983] HCA 12 ; (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 602; (1983) ATPR 40-350 at 44,218. 4. Views as to the necessary extent of trading activity have varied. It must be a substantial corporate activity (Barwick CJ in Adamson at 208); the trading activities must form a sufficiently significant proportion of the corporation's overall activities (Mason J in Adamson at 233, with Jacobs J concurring at 237); the trading activities should not be insubstantial (Murphy J in Adamson at 239); the corporation must carry on trading activities on a significant scale: (Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ in State Superannuation Board at 304; 43,976-43,977; Deane J in Commonwealth v Tasmania [1983] HCA 21 ; (1983) 57 ALJR 450 at 559-560. 5. An incorporated sporting body can be a trading corporation if its activities meet the required test: Adamson. 6. In particular, incorporation under a statute such as the Associations Incorporation Act does not prevent a corporate body from being a trading corporation if its activities warrant that description: Adamson at 232. 7. Trading denotes the activity of providing, for reward, goods or services: Re Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Society (No 12) Ltd (1978) 36 FLR 134 at 139; St George County Council at 569-570; Bevanere Pty Ltd v Lubidineuse [1985] FCA 134 ; (1985) 7 FCR 325 at 330-331; (1985) ATPR 40-565 at 46,568. 8. The Trade Practices Act itself draws a distinction between trading corporations and financial corporations; nevertheless the two classes are not mutually exclusive: State Superannuation Board at 303. 147 I note, nonetheless, that in the State Superannuation Board v Trade Practices Commission [1982] HCA 72 ; (1982) 150 CLR 282 , Mason, Murphy and Deane JJ said, at 303: ... [T]he decision in Adamson is of importance for two reasons. First, the majority of the Court (Barwick CJ, Mason, Jacobs and Murphy JJ), rejecting the argument that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is the sole or principal criterion of its character as a trading corporation. 148 This passage indicates that the purpose for which a corporation is formed is not the ""sole"" or ""principal"" criterion for the purposes of characterisation. The passage suggests, however, that the purpose of the formation of a corporation is not irrelevant in that process. 149 The contention for the applicant in both proceedings in this case is that when one looks at the totality of the evidence, including the historical evidence concerning the function of the Etheridge Shire Council, in particular, the fundamental functions of the shire council, being the legislative and administrative responsibility as a local government for the local government area, it is impossible to conclude that the Etheridge Shire Council is a trading corporation. 150 I have set out in detail the evidence in relation to what is said to be the trading activities of the council. 151 All of them, in my opinion, including even the road works aspect of the activity of the council, after close analysis, entirely lack the essential quality of trade. Almost all of them run at a loss. They are all directed, in my view, to public benefit objectives within the shire. Their scale, even in monetary terms (putting to one side the non-monetary significance of the legislative and executive activity of the shire council), are so inconsequential and incidental to the primary activity and function of the Council as to the deny to the Council the characterisation of a ""trading corporation"" or a ""financial corporation""."
Case11919,followed,SmithKline Beecham PLC v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 271,"The share account statements referred to in paragraph 47 of the affidavit of Ian Carey dated 5 November 2007. The Respondent's Notice of Motion seeking to set aside this Notice to Produce is that filed on 14 December 2007. 2 Also before the Court is an oral application made by the Respondent seeking to set aside a second Notice to Produce served by the Applicants and dated 1 February 2008. That Notice to Produce seeks the production of: Advice from Naomi Sharp dated 20 December 2007. 3 The first Notice to Produce , dated 29 November 2007, invokes Order 15A, rule 6 of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth), which provides as follows: Discovery from prospective respondent Where: (a) there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained; (b) after making all reasonable inquiries, the applicant has not sufficient information to enable a decision to be made whether to commence a proceeding in the Court to obtain that relief; and (c) there is reasonable cause to believe that that person has or is likely to have or has had or is likely to have had possession of any document relating to the question whether the applicant has the right to obtain the relief and that inspection of the document by the applicant would assist in making the decision; the Court may order that that person shall make discovery to the applicant of any document of the kind described in paragraph (c). The present provision of relevance is paragraph (c) and the discretion conferred. 4 Argument this morning proceeded upon the basis that the success or failure of the Motion could be tested by looking at the first document described in the Notice to Produce , namely, the statement of the two accounts. The Affidavit of Ian Carey referred to in the Notice to Produce , being that sworn on 5 November 2007, provided in paragraph 10 as follows: In January 2000, the deposit from the sale of the 37 Carr Street property (after deduction of the agent's commission) of $120,432 had been paid into my bank account at Bank of Melbourne by mistake. This account was later closed and the funds transferred to another account of mine in Australia. 5 On behalf of the Respondent it was submitted that Rule 6(c) required a three stage progression namely: 1) an inquiry as to whether there was "" reasonable cause to believe ""; 2) whether there were any documents in the possession of his client, or likely to have been in the possession of his client, relating to the question of whether the Applicants had a "" right to obtain the relief ""; and 3) the exercise of the Court's discretion, that discretion being conferred by the phrase "" the Court may order "". Left to one side has been the resolution of any question as to whether compliance with previous orders of this Court, or non-compliance, could contribute to the Court forming a view that there was a "" reasonable cause to believe "". 6 For present purposes it was accepted by the Respondent that the bank accounts referred to in paragraph 10 of the Affidavit indicated that there were documents likely to have been in the possession of the Respondent, and that such documents could "" relat [e] to "" the question of whether the Applicants had a "" right to obtain the relief "". Attention on behalf of the Respondent was thus focused upon the exercise of the Court's discretion. 7 Considerable caution must be exercised in ordering the production of documents in circumstances where the application before the Court is an order under Order 15A of the Federal Court Rules . In SmithKline Beecham PLC v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 271 Finkelstein J observed: [19] O15A is designed to enable a person to determine whether he has a good cause of action against a prospective defendant. It is not designed to secure for a prospective plaintiff all the documents and other information that would be discoverable if a proceeding were commenced against the defendant. Nevertheless, some ""fishing"" must be permitted, for otherwise there will be little scope for the operation of the rule. Speaking generally, however, once a person is in a position to make a decision whether he has a good (or perhaps arguable) cause of action, the criteria to be satisfied before an order can be made under O15A, r6 will not be satisfied. 8 In the circumstances of the present case, however, it is considered that the Applicants fall within the ambit of Order 15A, rule 6 and that the discretion should be exercised in their favour. Relevant to the exercise of the discretion is the potential importance of the documents which have been sought in the resolution of the question as to whether the Applicants have a right to obtain relief. The statements of the two accounts referred to in paragraph 10 of the Respondent's Affidavit , it is considered, are of considerable potential importance. 9 In the absence of any distinction being drawn between the documents identified in paragraph 1, as opposed to the Notice to Produce generally, it is thus considered that production should be ordered of all of those documents identified in paragraphs 1 7 of the first Notice to Produce . 10 The second Notice to Produce , dated 1 February 2008, seeks the production of an advice from Naomi Sharp of counsel."
Case8294,referred to,Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321,"The meaning and implications of the statutory notion of 'decision', where used in the ADJR Act, was comprehensively explained by the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond [1990] HCA 33 ; (1990) 170 CLR 321. It was emphasised by Mason CJ at 335 (with whose reasons Brennan J agreed, as did Deane J other than in relation to a particular matter not here material) that such meaning must be determined by reference to the text, scope and purpose of the legislation, and further that the remedial nature of the ADJR Act indicates that no narrow view is to be taken of the notion of 'decision' in that statutory context. Moreover his Honour pointed out at 336 that the concept of 'a reviewable decision is a decision which a statute requires or authorises, rather than merely a step taken in the course of reasoning on the way to the making of the ultimate decision', and further that 'the examples of a decision listed in the extended definition contained in s 3(2) [of the ADJR Act] are also indicative of a decision having the character or quality of finality, [being] an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application, inquiry or dispute ...'. Section 3(3) of the ADJR Act, which extends the statutory definition of 'decision' to '... the making of a report or recommendation before a decision is made in the exercise of a power ', was said by his Honour to operate to '... qualif[y] the characteristic of finality'. Moreover the Chief Justice explained that '... acts done preparatory to the making of a ""decision"" are not to be regarded as constituting ""decisions"" for, if they were, there would be little, if any, point in providing for judicial review of ""conduct"" as well as of a ""decision"".' 28 In the further course of his reasons for judgment in Bond at 337, Mason CJ pointed out that '... a reviewable ""decision"" is one for which provision is made by or under a statute', which '... will generally, but not always, entail a decision which is final or operative and determinative, at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration', so long of course '... that it be a substantive determination', as opposed to 'procedural determinations'. 29 The applicants focused those explanations and expositions of the Chief Justice upon s 111 of the Act, which refers to power conferred upon the Authority inter alia to revoke or vary any condition of a licence which it may have previously imposed, and submitted that so much did not mean that a refusal to exercise any such positive power on the part of the Authority did not constitute a decision made under s 111. It was pointed out in that regard, in my opinion rightly, that there are many statutes in which the decision-making power is expressed only in terms of a positive discretion, without express reference to the power to make a decision of a negative character, yet in such cases it is necessarily implicit that a negative decision would also be made under that provision. Otherwise, so it was further emphasised by the present applicants, paras (a), (b) and (g) of s 3(2) of the ADJR Act would be otiose. Those subsections read as follows (the emphasis appearing in non-italics is mine): 's 3(2) In this Act, a reference to the making of a decision includes a reference to: (a) making, suspending, revoking or refusing to make an order, award or determination; (b) giving, suspending, revoking or refusing to give a certificate, direction, approval, consent or permission; ... (g) doing or refusing to do any other act or thing...' 31 The Authority sought to deny any conclusion as to the existence of a justiciable decision by characterising its first decision as declining to even consider the exercise of any discretion under s 111 of the Act. In the applicants' submission that purported characterisation was misconceived, and must be rejected, for the following reasons: (i) the decision not to exercise its power under s 111 to vary a condition of the licence was indeed final, operative and determinative, in the practical sense described in Bond and in Right to Life [cedilla] of AusCoast's ability to continue to broadcast under the auspices of the 1620 licence from the current site at Tingalpa; (ii) any such characterisation sits at least uncomfortably with the terms of the Authority's letter of 30 June 2005, containing as it does the assertion '[a]s a result the [Authority] will not exercise its discretionary power under section 111 of the [Act] and vary licence conditions in the terms proposed by [WAL]'; (iii) the decision not to exercise the power was one which was authorised by and therefore made under s 111 of the Act, since s 111 confers a discretionary power, and hence contemplates that a decision whether or not to exercise that discretion could be made, there being no other source of power for such a decision. I think that there is force in each of the foregoing submissions of the applicants. 48 Ryan J found that the Minister there had not received advice from a local Aboriginal community in accordance with s 21D(1), and thus the issue of relevance was whether or not the Minister's decision not to determine[e] on his...own motion that a temporary declaration of preservation should be made was a reviewable decision for the purposes of s 5(1) of the ADJR Act. The Minister had informed the applicants in writing that he would 'consider' their request for a determination on his own motion, but later told the applicants that he would not do so pending the resolution of another proceeding before this Court involving the same artefacts. His Honour found that the Minister's decision was a decision to decline to determine[e]...on his own motion and was thus made 'preparatory' to the making of a decision to determine to make a temporary declaration. Alternatively, his Honour characterised the decision declining to so determine[e] as 'a conclusion reached as a step on the way to an ultimate decision', which is not reviewable, for that reason also, thereby referring to dicta to like effect at 337 of Mason CJ's reasons for judgment in Bond . 59 Thus by way of reflection of the dictum I have cited from Bond , the communications of the Authority as evidenced from the outset by its faxed response of 16 August 2004 to the applicants' application of 6 August 2004 and thereafter, inclusive of its critical communication to WAL of 30 June 1995, the Authority indicated to the applicants the position which it had adopted or taken as inherently and essentially indicative of decision-making on its part, the same having for instance the 'character or quality of finality', and constituting and involving 'an outcome reflecting something in the nature of a determination of an application' within the scope of that dictum of Mason CJ in Bond I have earlier cited. That communication of the Authority constituted or involved a decision 'at least in a practical sense, of the issue of fact falling for consideration'. It was 'a substantive determination' as opposed to a 'procedural determination', to adopt the Chief Justice's further dictum in Bond ."
Case10148,applied,The Architects (Australia) Pty Ltd v Witty Consultants Pty Ltd [2002] QSC 139,"these different objectives, it is not uncommon for a plaintiff to place reliance upon both s 52 of the Trade Practices Act and the tort of passing off: e.g. The Architects (Australia) Pty Ltd v Witty Consultants Pty Ltd [2002] QSC 139. There are "" close similarities "" between the two causes of action: Osgaig Pty Ltd v Ajisen (Melbourne) Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1394 at [80] , [2004] FCA 1394 ; 213 ALR 153 at 167 per Weinberg J. Indeed, authorities which have considered the common law tort of passing off provide guidance by analogy as to the type of conduct which would be likely to mislead or deceive the public for the purposes of s 52: R &amp; C Products Pty Ltd v SC Johnson &amp; Sons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 198 ; (1993) 42 FCR 188 at 192 per Davies J. The tort has been applied in more recent times to circumstances in which a defendant passes off his goods or services as those of the plaintiff by means of an impermissible use of a domain name: e.g. The Architects (Australia) [2002] QSC 139 at [34] per Chesterman J. In determining whether a plaintiff has established distinctiveness in the name or names with which it contends that the goodwill which it seeks to protect has become associated, useful guidance is provided by the following observations of Hill J in Equity Access Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation [1989] FCA 506 ; (1989) 16 IPR 431 at 448: Just as the distinction between descriptive and fancy names is not a distinction of law so too it is wrong to see the distinction in black and white terms. The reality is that there is a continuum with at the extremes purely descriptive names at the one end, completely invented names at the other and in between, names that contain ordinary English words that are in some way or other at least partly descriptive. The further along the continuum towards the fancy name one goes, the easier it will be for a plaintiff to establish that the words used are descriptive of the plaintiff's business. The closer along the continuum one moves towards a merely descriptive name the more a plaintiff will need to show that the name has obtained a secondary meaning, equating it with the products of the plaintiff (if the name admits of this &#8212; a purely descriptive name probably will not) and the easier it will be to see a small difference in names as adequate to avoid confusion. There need not be an exact or even substantial similarity in the nature of the two businesses: The Architects (Australia) [2002] QSC 139 at [27] to [28] per Chesterman J. The reference to the "" Performing Right Society test "" is a reference to Performing Right Society Ltd v Ciryl Theatrical Syndicate Ltd [1924] 1 KB 1 at 15 where Atkin LJ said: If the directors themselves directed or procured the commission of the act they would be liable in whatever sense they did so, whether expressly or impliedly. In Microsoft Corporation v Auschina Polaris Pty Ltd (1996) 71 FCR 231 at 243 to 244, Lindgren J said of this test: The ""procured or directed"" test, sometimes referred to as the ""authorised, procured or directed"" test, focuses attention on the relationship between the director's intention and the particular corporate conduct which the law characterises as tortious. What seems to underlie this test is the notion that, necessarily, companies can engage in tortious conduct only through human beings, and, at least ordinarily, where a particular human being involved and responsible to an appropriate extent can be identified, he should, as a matter of policy, be liable. After all, even if the aggrieved party did not sue him, apparently he would be liable to indemnify the company in respect of its liability to the aggrieved party. A director who "" procures or directs "" his company to perform a tortious act may thus be liable along with his company: The Architects (Australia) Pty Ltd [2002] QSC 139 at [51] per Chesterman J."

Case18401,cited,Dowling v St Vincent De Paul Society of Victoria Inc [2003] VSC 454,"In Dowling v St Vincent De Paul Society of Victoria Inc [2003] VSC 454 Nettle J took a somewhat more restrictive view of the breadth of s 19(1)(f) of the Trustee Act 1958 (Vic) being the comparable Victorian provision. That case concerned the efficacy of an agreement to compromise a probate proceeding in which the validity of a will was contested. The question was whether s 19(1)(f) authorised the executors to enter into the compromise in anticipation of a grant of probate. Nettle J reached the view that s 19(1)(f) did not authorise an executor to compromise a dispute as to the validity of a will without the consent of affected parties or an order of the Court that bound them. At [19] his Honour said: '19 Despite what has been said about the breadth of s 19(1)(f) I do not consider that s 19(1)(f) empowers an executor as such to compromise a probate proceeding in which the validity of the will is contested.' His Honour continued at [21]: '21 The word ""claim"" is capable in some contexts of including almost any sort of demand. Equally, according to context, the conception of things which relate to an estate may include a very broad range of possible subject matters. But it requires no recitation of authority to establish that the words of a statutory provision are to be read in context and according to the apparent purpose of the provision. And in their context and according to what I perceive to [be] the purpose of the s 19 of the Trustee Act , ""claims relating to ... the estate"" appear as limited to claims upon or against the estate. With respect, I think the observations of Sir Robert Megarry VC in Re Earl of Strafford to be persuasive. The section is concerned with claims against the estate be they from the outside world or as between the beneficiaries not proceedings to determine the title of the executor or trustee.' 91 It may be seen from the above that Nettle J took the view that the relevant section could lead to compromises of claims by the relevant trustees or against them."
Case3307,cited,Re Gillies [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 115 ALR 631,"Section 131 has been repealed. However, the Bankruptcy Act still contemplates that income earned after the bankrupt's bankruptcy does not vest in the bankrupt's trustee: Re Gillies [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 115 ALR 631 at 636-637. Whilst the trustee may require the bankrupt to make contributions out of the bankrupt's income, the Bankruptcy Act contemplates that those contributions will be made out of income in the hands of the bankrupt not the trustee. 73 The position therefore is no different from the position when s 131 was part of the Bankruptcy Act or s 101 part of the 1924 Bankruptcy Act . The bankrupt's income, after bankruptcy, does not vest in the bankrupt's trustee. 74 If the bankrupt's income does not vest in the trustee, it must be because it is not property or at least property divisible among the bankrupt's creditors. 82 The Court went on to say: A convenient summary of these provisions is to be found in the reasons of French J in Re Gillies; Ex parte Official Receiver in Bankruptcy [1993] FCA 289 ; (1993) 42 FCR 571. In that case his Honour held that although s 131(1) which had entitled ""a bankrupt who is in receipt of income"" to retain it for his own benefit had been repealed, Div 4B ""rests upon the continuing assumption that the income of the bankrupt does not vest in the trustee"". We are in respectful agreement with that view; but it does not, of course, bear upon the question whether a cause of action for breach of a contract which would, if carried out, have produced income for the bankrupt vests in the trustee."

Case19575,cited,Aljade and MKIC v OCBC [2004] VSC 351,"That assessment will take account of the complexity of the issues and the basis upon which the Court resolved the controversy. Although an applicant may have been unsuccessful in obtaining the relief sought, the applicant may have successfully resisted a significant proportion of what was said to be an answer to the relief claimed. An applicant may have established the integers of the cause of action upon which the relief is based yet relief may be refused on discretionary grounds. Although in an absolute sense, a respondent simply seeks to resist the relief sought in the proceeding and any successful ground of doing so is sufficient , the basis upon which the Court resolves the controversy assists in understanding whether an unsuccessful applicant acted reasonably in electing to proceed and thus assume the risk of a less favourable outcome than that available when choosing to go on. The letter of offer need not nor should it, engage in an analysis of the underlying contentions. The focus of the letter is to put the offer in clear and precise terms so that the recipient can understand what is offered and the Court can later see without obfuscation just exactly what was offered and rejected.

The power to transfer under the Trade Practices Act is stated in discretionary terms.

Case7543,considered,Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328,"In regard to the construction and application of Table 13.1 in the Approved Guide, Mr Bryant's submission was that the Tribunal's reliance on an earlier Tribunal decision, O'Rourke v Comcare [1997] AATA 304 , led it to apply an incorrect construction of the term ""minor interference"". Mr Byrant's submissions proceeded as follows. The global approach to ""minor interference"" in O'Rourke v Comcare , is contrary to the approach the Court has taken to interpreting the Guide in Whittaker v Comcare [1998] FCA 1099 ; (1998) 86 FCR 532 and Comcare v Fiedler [2001] FCA 1810 ; (2001) 115 FCR 328. These cases are, it was submitted, supportive of the proposition that, where there is ambiguity in a phrase, as there is with ""minor interference"", then the Tribunal should take the approach most favourable to the employee. If the global approach in O'Rourke v Comcare has the effect of limiting or reading down the meaning of ""minor interference"" then it ought not be followed. If an ""activity of daily living"" (ADL) is interrupted, temporarily suspended or ceased altogether because of a headache that amounted, it was submitted, to an interference and whether it is minor or significant depended on the frequency, duration and severity of attacks. Where headaches amount to more than a de minimus interference with ADL, it was submitted that this would then constitute a ""minor interference"". It was submitted that Mr Bryant's medical history, as provided to Dr Lethlean, which history was assumed to be uncontroversial, would fall within the meaning of ""minor interference"" so construed and hence amounted to a 10% impairment under Table 13.1 of the Approved Guide. 29 On behalf of the Commission, it was submitted that the comparison between the term ""difficulty"", as considered in Whittaker v Comcare and Comcare v Fiedler , and the term ""interference"" as used in Table 13.1 of the Approved Guide was not appropriate to support a de minumus argument. In support, the Commission pointed to the observation of the Full Court in Fiedler at [24] that, ""There is no reason to think the Tribunal considered that any difficulty with digital dexterity, no matter how slight, was sufficient to come within par 1 of Table 9.4""."
Case14956,applied,D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385,"The ordinary rules of construction that apply to any written instrument are applicable to the construction of the specification of a patent: Nobel's Explosives Co Ltd v Anderson (1894) 11 RPC 519 at 523; D&eacute;cor Corporation Pty Ltd v Dart Industries Inc (1988) 13 IPR 385 (' D&eacute;cor ') at 391, 400; Photocure at [168]. However, there are also a number of special considerations that are relevant to the construction of a patent. The general basis for these rules was explained by Hely J in Beltreco at [70]: 'A patent is a public instrument which grants the right to protection of a defined monopoly, for the consideration of the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society. It is the need for balance between these symbiotic, yet competing interests which underscores the rules of patent construction.' 16 It is well established that the claims contained in the specification set out the legal limits of the monopoly. Yet, when construing the claims and determining the nature and extent of this monopoly it is necessary to consider the context in which the claims are made. This requires a consideration of the specification as a whole even if there is no apparent ambiguity in the claim; Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co v Beiersdorf (Australia) Ltd [1980] HCA 9 ; (1980) 144 CLR 253 (' Minnesota Mining ') at 267-272; D&eacute;cor at 410-411; Beltreco at [75]-[78]. The specification is made up of several parts which have different functions: Welch Perrin &amp; Co Pty Ltd v Worrel [1960] HCA 91 ; (1961) 106 CLR 588 (' Welch Perrin ') at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Beltreco at [73]. Nevertheless, reference to it as a whole may explain or elucidate the background to the claims, assist in ascertaining the meaning of a technical term or in resolving ambiguities in the construction of claims: Martin v Scribal Pty Ltd [1954] HCA 48 ; (1954) 92 CLR 17 (' Martin ') per Taylor J at 97; Welch Perrin at 610-611; Electric &amp; Musical Industries Ltd v Lissen Ltd (1939) 56 RPC 23 (' Electric &amp; Musical Industries ') at 41-42, Interlego AG v Toltoys Pty Ltd [1973] HCA 1 ; (1973) 130 CLR 461 (' Interlego ') at 478-479; D&eacute;cor at 400; Sartas No 1 Pty Ltd v Koukourou &amp; Partners Pty Ltd (1994) 30 IPR 479 (' Sartas ') at 486; Beltreco at [75]. 17 It is important, however, that the focus of the inquiry remain on the claims under consideration. If claims are clear and unambiguous, they are not to be varied, qualified or made obscure by statements found in other parts of the patent: Welch Perrin at 610; Interlego at 478-479; Electric &amp; Musical Industries at 41; Rosedale Associated Manufacturers Ltd v Carlton Tyre Saving Co Ltd [1960] RPC 59 at 69; Cooper Industries Inc v Metal Manufactures Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 106 at 113; Lantech Inc v First Green Park Pty Ltd (1995) 31 IPR 327 at 333; Beltreco at [74]. It is not legitimate to narrow or expand the boundaries of the monopoly as fixed by the words of the claims by adding to those words a gloss drawn from other parts of the specification: Welch Perrin at 610; D&eacute;cor at 391, 398; Braas &amp; Co GmbH v Humes Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 273 at 284; Beltreco at [74]. 18 A patent specification should be given a purposive rather than a purely literal construction: Catnic Components Ltd v Hill &amp; Smith Ltd [1982] RPC 183 (' Catnic ') at 242-243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Improver Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd [1990] FSR 181 (' Improver '); Nicaro Holdings Pty Ltd v Martin Engineering Co (1989-1990) 16 IPR 545 at 560-561; Commonwealth Industrial Gases Ltd v M W A Holdings Pty Ltd (1970) 44 ALJR 385 at 388; Beltreco at [81]; Kirin-Amgen Inc v Hoeschst Marion Roussel Ltd (2004) 64 IPR 444 (' Kirin-Amgen '); Sachtler at [43]-[67]. It is inappropriate, however, to approach construction of the specification with a view to being 'fair' to the patentee; Kirin-Amgen at [33]; Sachtler at [60]. The fact that the monopoly is granted in consideration for the disclosure of the invention to the general knowledge base of society must be recognised: Beltreco at [70]. Indeed, the principles governing a definition of a monopoly operating over the public at large require a description of the claims that 'is not reasonably capable of misunderstanding': Martin at 59. The patentee must define the invention with sufficient precision to permit the monopoly to be determined and allow the general public to identify from the words of the claims the conduct prohibited: British United Shoe Machinery Co Ltd v A Fussell &amp; Sons Ltd (1908) 25 RPC 631 at 650-651. The public are entitled to be able to design around the monopoly claimed in a patent and therefore they must be able to determine reliably the scope of the claims: Beloit Technologies Inc v Valmat Paper Machinery Inc [1895] 24 RPC 705 at 720. 20 The hypothetical addressee of the patent specification is the non-inventive person skilled in the art before the priority date: Welch Perrin at 610; Populin v HB Nominees Pty Ltd (1982) 41 ALR 471 (' Populin ') at 476-477; Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Pty Ltd v Avion Engineering Pty Ltd (1991) 103 ALR 239 at 260; D&eacute;cor at 397; Stanway Oyster Cylinders Pty Ltd v Marks (1996) 66 FCR 577 at 582-583; Beltreco at [81]; Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Limited v Arico Trading International Pty Limited [2001] HCA 8 ; (2001) 207 CLR 1 at [24] ; Gambro Pty Ltd v Fresenius Medical Care South East Asia Pty Ltd (2004) 61 IPR 442 at [113]; Rhone-Poulenc Agrochimie SA v UIM Chemical Services Pty Ltd (1986) 12 FCR 477 at 496; NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International Pty Ltd (1993) 26 IPR 513 (' NV Philips ') at 531; Catnic at 225; Wheatley (Davina) v Drillsafe Ltd [2001] RPC 7 at 141 142. Thus, the words used in a specification are to be given the meaning that the hypothetical addressee would attach to them, both in the light of his or her own general knowledge and what is disclosed in the body of the specification: D&eacute;cor at 391; Photocure at [170]. 25 A feature of a claim is considered essential if the hypothetical reader (that is, a reader skilled in the art before the priority date) would have understood from the language used in the claim, in the context of the specification as a whole, that the patentee intended that strict compliance was an essential requirement of the invention: Catnic at 243; D&eacute;cor at 400; Populin at 476; Beltreco at [81]."
Case5030,discussed,Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 ,"noted above, Comandate Marine's proceedings in rem contained no such request. And, Art 8(1) of the Model Law, relevantly requires a court in which an action is brought in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement to refer the parties to arbitration, if a party so requests no later than when submitting its first statement on the substance of the dispute. 59 Russell on Arbitration (22 nd ed) at 610 [A5-018] refers to Art 8(1) having the same effect as English law; i.e. the party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement must apply to the court without delay for a stay of the proceedings (op cit at 296 [7-005]). The position is similar under s 53(2) of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW) which applies here by force of s 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). Comandate Marine did not apply to have its proceedings referred to arbitration when they were before this Court or the High Court. I am of opinion that Comandate Marine's conduct in bringing its proceedings in rem was incompatible with the arbitration agreement, and that Art 8(1) and Art 9 of the Model Law do not avail it. Comandate Marine is in a similar position to that of the landlord in the example given by Parker J in Matthews v Smallwood [1910] 1 Ch at 786-787. By pleading the writ in the way which it did, Comandate Marine exercised a right of action given by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) to litigate the breach of the charter party as a general maritime claim under s 4(3)(f) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) in this Court. I am of opinion that in choosing to claim only that relief when it invoked the jurisdiction of the Court, Comandate Marine could not do that without prejudice to any right it might otherwise have had to seek security for the arbitration under s 29 at a later stage. It made no such claim in the writ and it procured the arrest of the vessel for the purposes of the particular relief which it claimed in the writ. The way in which Comandate Marine framed its claim in the writ nailed its colours to the mast as much as the warrant for arrest later was nailed (notionally or actually) to the mast of the Boomerang I . Having invoked the jurisdiction of the Court to procure the arrest of the vessel in order to pursue the only claims it pleaded, it is not open to Comandate Marine now to say that it did so without prejudice to any right later to apply for security under s 29 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). In its report: Civil Admiralty Jurisdiction (Report No 33, 1986) Law Reform Commission (Australia), the Commission recommended the introduction of what has become s 29 so as to enable the Admiralty jurisdiction to be used to obtain and retain security even though the merits of the dispute are to be determined elsewhere, if the subject matter of the dispute lies within Admiralty jurisdiction. The Commission noted that such a solution would do most to ensure that the award of the tribunal that decides upon the merits is satisfied, and hence that a just result would be obtained. It noted that the law had a strong interest in compliance with arbitral awards duly made, and in achieving co-operation between courts and arbitrators to this end. However, the Commission desired, in the solution it proposed, that the Court should retain a discretion to stay or to exercise jurisdiction to decide the merits (ALRC 33 [189]). That discretion was to arise in the Court being able to take into account all relevant circumstances although the Commission noted that, as at 1986, English and South African courts required the plaintiff to demonstrate why the assistance of a court was required in retaining security, although there were shades of difference between the readiness of the respective jurisdictions to assist in respect of claims otherwise unconnected with the forum: The Tuyuti [1984] QB 838 at 851; Katagum Wholesale Commodities v The MV Paz 1984 (3) SAf LR 261 at 268, 270 (Natal Provincial Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa). Neither party argued that the analysis of the present question should be approached on the basis that there had been a contract of abandonment such as in Paal Wilson &amp; Co A/S v Partenreederei Hannah Blumenthal [1983] 1 AC 854 at 915-916. There, Lord Diplock considered that abandonment of a contract, which was still executory, involved the formation of a contract of abandonment in which each party promised to release the other from performance of all further obligations, including the obligation to pay damages for past breaches, arising under the executory, and now abandoned, contract. Lord Brandon of Oakbrook, who gave the leading speech (see [1983] 1 AC 900C per Lord Diplock) said that the question of whether a contract has been abandoned or not is one of fact ([1983] 1 AC at 913F). He continued ([1983] 1 AC at 914A-C): 'The concept of the implied abandonment of a contract as a result of the conduct of the parties to it is well established in law : see Chitty on Contracts , 23 rd ed. (1968), vol 1, p 577, para 1231, and cases there cited. Where A seeks to prove that he and B have abandoned a contract in this way, there are two ways in which A can put his case. The first way is by showing that the conduct of each party, as evinced to the other party and acted on by him, leads necessarily to the inference of an implied agreement between them to abandon the contract. The second method is by showing that the conduct of B, as evinced towards A, has been such as to lead A reasonably to believe that B has abandoned the contract, even though it has not in fact been B's intention to do so, and that A has significantly altered his position in reliance on that belief. The first method involves actual abandonment by both A and B. The second method involves the creation by B of a situation in which he is estopped from asserting, as against A, that he, B, has not abandoned the contract : Pearl Mill Co v Ivy Tannery Co Ltd [1919] 1 KB 78.' This contractual analysis is inapposite here, but their Lordships' approach shows that, notwithstanding that arbitration proceedings have been regularly commenced and that both parties are bound to their pursuit, the conduct of one party or both parties can bring about the legal consequence that the parties' obligations to arbitrate in the arbitration proceedings have become abandoned or inoperative or incapable of being performed. In international trade and commerce, it is critical that the courts respect and enforce arbitration agreements where they exist in accordance with, in particular, the New York Convention and legislation designed to give effect to it such as the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth). This is because in international trade and commerce, the parties generally will not wish to be subject to serendipity of where a ship may be arrested, an action begun or damage occur to determine a forum of any litigation between them or the substantive law to be applied to their dispute. The parties will be conscious that an accident or fortuity may occur at any point in a voyage or flight and very different legal results may flow depending on which law and which forum determine their dispute. It is for this reason that arbitration clauses such as cl 45(b) invoking arbitration in London under English law have been a popular recourse for parties in international trade for over a century. Nowadays other centres of commercial arbitration, including Australia, are recognized as providing sound and fair fora and laws for the resolution of disputes in international trade or commerce. However, the Court should be astute to uphold and enforce agreements such as those in cl 45(b) rather than to display a form of judicial prejudice or xenophobia against the parties' chosen method or place of dispute resolution. Refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate in international transactions is capable of undermining the reasonable but significant expectations of the international commercial community and the confidence which it and, indeed, local business people place in the readiness of courts to hold people to their bargains: see e.g.: Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M/V Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 538 (1995); Mitsubishi Motors Corp v Soler Chrysler-Plymouth Inc 473 US 614, 638 (1985); Scherk v Alberto-Culver Co 417 US 506, 516 (1974); Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 343 per Brennan and Dawson JJ, 354 per Toohey J agreeing (cf: Nanisivik Mines Ltd v F.C.R.S. Shipping Ltd (1994) 113 DLR (4 th ) 536 at 541-542 (Federal Court of Appeal). But, just as parties may choose to invoke arbitration as the method by which their disputes will be resolved by use of an arbitration agreement such as in cl 45(b), so they may also choose to give up their rights to use that method or they may so conduct themselves that the choice will be attributed to them by the doctrine of election. When Comandate Marine chose to begin its in rem proceedings in the form which it utilized, it brought about the consequence that it was taken to have elected not to pursue its arbitration proceedings. It may have chosen another method to seek security by framing the relief it sought in its writ in a different way, but it did not do so. The English authorities on which Comandate Marine relied, and to which Sheppard J referred, did not consider the question of whether the party seeking security had made an election. For that reason I think those authorities are distinguishable. Because Comandate Marine elected to litigate the dispute and Pan has too, the arbitration agreement in cl 45(b) has been, in substance, abandoned or for the purposes of s 7(5) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) rendered inoperative or incapable of being performed. WAS THERE AN AGREEMENT IN WRITING? Pan argues that Art II r 2 of the New York Convention requires there to be either an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement which is either signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. Pan says that where the contract was formed, as it argues the charter party was in this case, either by acts or conduct, Art II r 2 is not satisfied. Pan says that each of the provision of the bank guarantee or the delivery of the vessel was an act or amounted to conduct which brought the contract into existence. In support of the argument it relies on decision of the Supreme Court of Italy in Robobar Limited v Finncold SaS (1995) Year Book Comm. Arb'n XX 739 at 740. The Court held that where a purchase confirmation had been sent by the party seeking to rely on the arbitration clause to which the other party had not responded, there was no doubt that none of the formalities in Art II in the New York Convention had been met because the clause was only contained in the confirmation to which the other party had not agreed by letter or telegram. Pan also relied on a decision of the Court of Appeal of the Federal Republic of Germany in a case between a Dutch seller and a German buyer ((1997) Year Book Comm. Arb'n Vol II, 237 at 238). The Court of Appeal held that a declaration in writing of both sides to the contract was required. A one sided confirmation did not suffice and the lack of declaration in writing by the other party could not be cured by that party's appearance in the arbitration. In this matter, however, the critical telex of 20 April 2006 commenced by being in form a confirmation, but ended with a request being made to both parties to confirm that the above recap was in line with the negotiations agreed so far. The next relevant correspondence was the telex later that day noting that the bank guarantee had been received and indicating when delivery would occur. I think this does fall within the positions contemplated by the Supreme Court of Italy and the German Court of Appeal, as being ones in which the contract was not formed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. And, In Zambia Steel &amp; Building Supplies Ltd v James Clark &amp; Eaton Ltd [1986] 2 Lloyd's Rep 225 at 234, Ralph Gibson LJ said: 'It is clear to me that the [New York] Convention by Art II par 2 did not impose upon the contracting state an obligation to recognise an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration unless it is signed by the parties or unless the agreement is contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams in the sense that the assent to be bound by both parties is given in writing by such document.' The Manitoba Court of Appeal noted in Proctor v Schellenberg [2003] 2 WWR 621 at 628 [18] that Art IV r 1(b) of the New York Convention requires a party seeking to obtain recognition and enforcement of an award, to provide '[t]he original agreement referred to in article II or a duly certified copy thereof'. They said that '... there had to be a record to evidence the agreement of the parties to resolve the dispute by arbitral process', in concluding that facsimile transmissions were sufficient to be or form part of an 'agreement in writing'. In A.J. van den Berg's The New York Arbitration Convention of 1958 (1981) at 196-198, 206, 277 the learned author notes that Art II r 2 excludes oral or tacit acceptance and concluded (at 197, 227) that, as at 1981 there had been only one '... exception to the unanimous judicial affirmation that tacit acceptance does not comply with Art II r 2', that being a decision of the Court of First Instance of Rotterdam. The learned author said that this decision was not in conformity with either the text of Art II r 2 or the intent of its drafters, and noted that the decision had been rightly criticised. Significantly, he referred to the history of Art II r 2 which confirmed that the drafters of the New York Convention wished to exclude from its scope oral or tacit acceptance of a written proposal to arbitrate. In his article 'Is the need for writing as expressed in the New York Convention and the Model Law out of step with commercial practice ? ' (1996) International Arbitration vol 12, no 1, p 27 at 32 Neil Kaplan QC affirmed Prof van den Berg's interpretation. Mr Kaplan referred to discussions that he had had with Prof Pieter Sanders, the Dutch delegate in the drafting of the Convention, who had given him the actual minutes of the delegate's consideration of Prof Sanders' proposal to add to the draft of Art II r 2 the following words: 'Confirmation in writing by one of the parties (which is kept) without contestation by the party.' (UN DOC E/CONF. 26L.54) The English and USSR delegates at the drafting session objected to that proposal and it was rejected (van den Berg: op cit at 196; Kaplan: op cit 32-33). Earlier, as Kaplan J, he had held in the High Court of Hong Kong in H Smal Limited v Goldroyce Garment Limited [1994] 2 HKC 526 (HCMP000 908/1994) that there was no basis for arguing that an arbitration agreement could be established by a course of dealing or the conduct of the parties under Art VII of the Model Law (see Schedule 2 to the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth)). Kaplan J said that he had looked at the UNCITRAL reports in relation to Art VII and was quite satisfied that it could not be complied with unless there was a record in which the defendant, in writing, assented to the agreement to arbitrate (see at [12]). It has been recognized that a national courts, in the interest of uniformity, should construe rules formulated by an international convention, especially rules formulated for the purpose of governing international transactions such as the hire of vessels or the carriage of goods, in a normal manner, appropriate for the interpretation of an international convention, unconstrained by technical rules of English or domestic law, or by English or domestic legal precedent, but on broad principles of general acceptation: Shipping Corporation of India Ltd v Gamlen Chemical Co Australasia Pty Ltd [1980] HCA 51 ; (1980) 147 CLR 142 at 159 per Mason and Wilson JJ adopting Lord Wilberforce's speech in James Buchanan &amp; Co Ltd v Babco Forwarding and Shipping (UK) Ltd [1978] AC 141 at 152 and see too: Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros SA v M/V Sky Reefer 515 US 528 at 537 (1995) per Kennedy J (Renquist CJ, Scalia, Souter, Thomas and Ginsberg JJ agreeing). Mason and Wilson JJ went on to say (147 CLR at 159): 'It is important that we should adhere to this approach when we are interpreting rules which have been formulated for the purpose of regulating the rights and liabilities of parties to international mercantile transactions where great store is set upon certainty and uniformity of application.' (see too Great China Metal Industries Ltd v Malayasian International Shipping Corporation Berhad [1998] HCA 65 ; (1988) 196 CLR 161 at 186 [71] per McHugh J) It is also important in construing international conventions, that the views taken by courts, particularly the Supreme Courts of nations, are kept in mind so that there can be consistency in interpretation. And, I am conscious that in s 3(1) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) the definition of 'arbitration agreement' is that it is an agreement of the kind referred to in Art II r 2. As a matter of construction under Australian law, I would have no hesitation in concluding that the definition was inclusive one. However, I think that the drafting of the definition in Art II r 2 invokes a concept of certainty that the arbitration clause or arbitration agreement is itself signed or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. The pre-contractual exchanges of telexes and emails cannot themselves convert into separate or free-standing agreements in the present case unless and until the vessel was actually agreed to be fixed. It was only upon the agreement to fix the vessel that it could be said to be under charter. And as Capt Piperakis said, he had imposed an absolute condition that a bank guarantee be provided. The owners were not prepared to deliver the vessel, on the evidence before me, unless and until the bank guarantee had been received and it was at that point that they agreed that they were contractually bound. That agreement, which thus brought cl 45(b) into existence as an agreement to arbitrate, was manifested by Comandate Marine's conduct either in accepting the bank guarantee or later delivering the vessel. At common law a recap telex can be found to contain a charter party, including an arbitration clause which is incorporated by reference to an earlier telex or other communication, even though both parties have not executed it: The Epsilon Rosa [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep 509 at 514 [21] per Tuckey LJ (May and Brooke LJJ agreeing). But as Tuckey LJ pointed out ([2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 515 [29]) one cannot generalize in these cases. The act of acceptance, which formed the contract, was the provision of the bank guarantee. And, it is common ground that a formal charter party incorporating all of the agreed terms was to be prepared later by Prime on behalf of Comandate Marine. Both parties were under a duty to co-operate to bring about the final form of their agreement in writing ( Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Limited [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607 per Mason J applying Butt v M'Donald (1896) 7 QLJ 68 at 70-71 per Griffith CJ). No doubt cl 45(b) was part of the agreement between Pan and Comandate Marine. But that does not, of itself, comply with Art II r 2. Rather, the critical part of the conduct by which the contract was formed was the provision by a third party of the bank guarantee which brought the contract into existence. So, the contract (being or including the arbitration agreement) was not made by being signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of telexes or emails. The contract included the conduct of the provision of the bank guarantee which fell outside the scope of Art II r 2. And, because there is no evidence of any further written communication relied on as amounting to a document capable of being part of an exchange of 'letters or telegrams' including telexes or emails, then this series of communications does not satisfy the requirements of Art II r 2. A contract can be made by conduct evidencing a manifestation of assent to an offer: Empirnall Holdings Pty Limited v Machon Paull Partners Pty Limited (1988) 14 NSWLR 523 at 534-535 per McHugh JA (Samuels JA agreeing at 531). Accordingly, I am of opinion that the telex from Prime to Mr Colaco headed 'FINAL RECAP' was an offer by Comandate Marine to charter the vessel on the terms there set out and incorporated by reference which was capable of acceptance only by the provision of the bank guarantee. For the reasons I have given, based on the fairly settled interpretation of Art II r 2 that tacit acceptance is insufficient, on the evidence I find that at the present time there is no 'agreement in writing' for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention. COMANDATE MARINE'S ALTERNATIVE CLAIM FOR STAY UNDER S 53 OF THE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION ACT 1984 (NSW) Comandate Marine argued, that if an agreement in writing for the purposes of s 7(2) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) were not found, I should grant a stay pursuant to s 53 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW). The Commercial Arbitration Act 1984 (NSW) provides that an arbitration agreement '... means an agreement in writing to refer present or future disputes to arbitration' (see s 4(1)). By s 53(1) the Court may stay the proceedings if it is satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the agreement and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. Having regard to the fact that Comandate Marine commenced its proceedings in rem, as I have found, without seeking to enforce any claim to arbitrate in those proceedings, I am of opinion that the evidence establishes that Comandate Marine was not then ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration. However, its application for stay is made in Pan's proceedings. At the time when Pan's proceedings were commenced, Comandate Marine was pursuing the arbitration proceedings and still seeks to do so now. I do not think that makes the commencement of the proceedings in rem irrelevant. By s 53(2) , the leave of the Court is required in the proceedings which have been commenced where the applicant for stay has delivered pleadings or taken any other steps in the proceedings other than the entry of an appearance. Although Comandate Marine's proceedings in rem were in separate proceedings, they form, as I have held, part of the same 'matter' for the purposes of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution , and I am not minded to exercise any discretion in favour of Comandate Marine having regard to its conduct in taking the in rem proceedings in the circumstances which I have found. SCOPE OF THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE Comandate Marine argued that the claims brought under ss 51A , 52 and 55A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and seeking relief under ss 82 and 87 , including relief setting aside ab initio the charter party and preventing Comandate Marine from enforcing against the plaintiff any arbitral award were 'colourable'. It was not put that the claims were an abuse of the process of the Court. Rather, it was put in oral argument that there had been a misuse of s 12 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) because the very complaints the subject of the claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) were, in essence, the same as the breaches of contract relied on by Pan. Comandate Marine, in written submissions asserted that the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims had been made for the improper purpose of fabricating jurisdiction. I do not think this argument has any substance. Part V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), in which s 52 is found, sets out a statutory norm of conduct to which corporations must conform in trade or commerce. The task of the Court is to apply such norms where they arise in litigation even where the outcome is not materially different to applying the common law of negligence as in Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 80 ALJR 183 at 191 [29] per Gleeson CJ or of passing off as in Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 83 [97] . In the latter case, the whole court approved what Mason J had said in Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 205 (see 202 CLR at 83 [97]), in the following terms: 'Likewise, the operation of s 52 is not restricted by the common law principles relating to passing-off. If, as I consider, the section provides the public with wider protection from deception than the common law, it does not follow that there is a conflict between the section and the common law. The statute provides an additional remedy .' (emphasis added) I am of opinion that the statutory remedy relied on by Pan is additional to whatever contractual remedies may be available to it and that there is no basis for the attribution to Pan of any improper purpose to fabricate jurisdiction. The Parliament of the Commonwealth has enacted the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) under the trade and commerce power in s 51(i) of the Constitution . There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that Pan has not properly and regularly invoked the Court's jurisdiction. Pan's pleading raises an issue of substance as to whether or not Comandate Marine engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. I am satisfied that this is truly part of the one controversy which the Court has been asked to quell (cf: D'Orta Ekenaike v Victorian Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12 ; (2005) 79 ALJR 755 at 761 [32] ). The only arguable limitation in the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) which might be seen as restricting the jurisdiction or powers any court invested with jurisdiction under that Act is to be found in s 13. But, on examination, s 13 does not affect the jurisdiction which a court, including this Court, has from sources other than the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) itself. Rather, s 13 provides that the Act does not confer on or invest jurisdiction on or in a court in a matter which is not of a kind mentioned in ss 76(ii) or (iii) of the Constitution . In ascertaining the scope of jurisdiction which the Federal Court may exercise, s 13 thus provides some guidance. It contemplates that matters of a kind mentioned in ss 76(ii) and (iii) of the Constitution can be within the jurisdiction of the Court. Section 76(iii) ('of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction') is a clear source of power to enact the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) itself and define maritime claims as well as associated matters of Admiralty and marine jurisdiction in ss 4 and 12 . And s 76(ii) provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth is invoked in any matter 'arising under any laws made by the Parliament'. The purpose of s 13 is to limit, in the construction of the Act, the conferral of jurisdiction by the Act to matters within the power of the Parliament and the judicial power of the Commonwealth. It is not to limit the other powers of a court on or in which the Act confers or invests jurisdiction. Clearly enough, s 86 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is a law made by the Parliament which confers jurisdiction on this Court independently of the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth). It is quite inappropriate to read provisions conferring jurisdiction or granting powers to a court by making implications or imposing limitations which are not found in the express words: Owners of ""Shin Kobe Maru"" v Empire Shipping Co Inc [1994] HCA 54 ; (1994) 181 CLR 404 at 421; see too Mansfield v Director of Public Prosecutions for Western Australia [2006] HCA 38 at [7] - [10] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Crennan JJ. Once the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked, the Court should exercise it ( Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally [1999] HCA 27 ; (1999) 198 CLR 511 at 588 [149] ), even if it be to protect itself and its processes against their abuse: cf: Batistatos v Roads and Traffic Authority [2006] HCA 27 [3]-[15] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ: see too: Elbe Shipping SA v The Ship 'Global Peace' [2006] FCA 954 at [138] per Allsop J, see too at [62]-[76]. Comandate Marine also argued that a limitation was imposed on courts exercising jurisdiction conferred by the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) by s 31. But s 31(1) provides that the liability on a judgment of a relevant person (defined by s 3(1) as a person who would be liable were the proceedings in personam brought against that person) who has entered an appearance in a proceeding on a maritime claim commenced as an action in rem against a ship or property is not limited to the value of the ship or other property. The section confirms the amplitude of the jurisdiction rather than restricts it. Next, Comandate Marine argued that a relevant person who appears in proceedings commenced by a writ in rem cannot be sued in proceedings in personam in this Court in respect of matters outside the relief claimed in the writ in rem on a cause of action other than a maritime claim within the meaning of s 4 of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) or on associated matters of admiralty and marine jurisdiction within the meaning of s 12 of that Act. Here, part of the 'matter', within the meaning of ss 76(ii) and (iii) of the Constitution , is the controversy between the parties under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which Pan has pleaded. The judicial power of the Commonwealth is exercised in resolving such 'matters'. Here, the controversy involves claims under two Acts of the Parliament each of which specifically and independently, one of the other, confers jurisdiction on this Court. Accordingly, I am of opinion that this Court does have jurisdiction to hear and determine such an in personam proceeding as this. That is not to say, however, that the ship or property the subject of the writ in rem will be available, necessarily, to answer any judgment for any in personam claim against a relevant person, such as one under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), which is neither a maritime claim or an associated matter within the meaning of ss 4 or 12 . I am of opinion that the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) cannot be construed as in any way limiting the jurisdiction of this Court to hear and determine any matter within its jurisdiction. Rather, appositely to the present proceedings, there may be a question at the trial as to the availability of the bank guarantee which Comandate Marine provided as security in lieu of the ship Comandate to satisfy a claim made by Pan which is not within ss 4 or 12 of the Act. Pan's claim in personam for relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is not invalid and its proceedings in personam are not invalidated by that claim: s 51 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The Court, at the final hearing, can address any injustice which might arise if Comandate Marine wishes then to agitate such matters, including whether the security provided should be available to satisfy any claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) provides Pan with remedies different to any remedy that could be awarded in pursuance of its contract claims. Indeed, one of the remedies it seeks is the avoidance of the contract, not pursuant to contractual principles, but by force of an order under s 87 of the Act: Murphy v Overton Investments Pty Limited [2004] HCA 3 ; (2004) 216 CLR 388 at 409 [52] . And, the High Court has emphasized that the remedies under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) are designed to give effect, in cases of contravention of s 52 , to the prescribed standards of conduct which are embodied in that section where activities occur in trade or commerce: Campomar Sociedad Limitada v Nike International Limited [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 at 83 [97] ; Travel Compensation Fund v Tambree [2005] HCA 69 ; (2005) 80 ALJR 183. International trade including the entry into charter parties for vessels, is quintessentially within the trade and commerce clause of the Constitution (s 51(i)). And, par 15 of the amended statement of claim pleads specifically that the relevant conduct occurred in Australia because the communications and representations were received by Mr Colaco in Australia (see Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty Limited [1990] HCA 55 ; (1990) 171 CLR 538 at 568 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; Sydbank Soenderjylland A/S v Bannerton Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 68 FCR 539 at 547A-548D per Beaumont, Drummond and Sundberg JJ). Next, Comandate Marine argued that I should not follow the decision of the Full Court in The 'Kiukiang Career' ( Hi-Fert Pty Limited v Kiukiang Maritime Carriers Inc (No 5) (1998) 90 FCR 1). In that case the relevant clause provided that 'any dispute arising from this charter' would be settled in a London arbitration. Obviously, it is important to recognize that in every contract the proper construction of that contract depends upon the words which the parties used having regard to contractual matrix within which the contract was entered or made. Emmett J who delivered the leading judgment (with whom Branson J expressly agreed) considered a number of authorities including some which dealt with the words used in this arbitration clause (cl 45(b)): viz: 'arising out of'. Emmett J said that a claim arising out of a contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) during the performance of an agreement could be a claim arising out of the agreement (90 FCR at 21G). But, he made the critical distinction that where there was a dispute in respect of conduct which was antecedent to the contract such a dispute could not be said to arise from the contract in question (90 FCR at 22A-B) and he observed that it did not arise out of the charter party (90 FCR at 22B-C). In Francis Travel Marketing Pty Limited v Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd (1996) 39 NSWLR 160 Gleeson CJ (Meagher and Sheller JJA agreeing) held that conduct claimed to be in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) which occurred wholly during the currency of an agreement arose out of the agreement, notwithstanding that statutory remedies were invoked, so that the whole matter was capable of settlement under the arbitration clause. Where it is claimed that a misrepresentation induced entry into an agreement, the fact that during the performance of an agreement it emerges that the pre-contractual conduct was misleading or deceptive or otherwise in contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) does not bring a statutory claim within the expression 'arising out of this contract'. Gleeson CJ had distinguished the reasoning of Beaumont J in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40 -636 on the basis that in that case the agreement to the parties was merely part of the background to the alleged contraventions of the Act and therefore the dispute did not arise out of the agreement. In the case before the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, the alleged contravention of the Act arose out of a representation that occurred during the currency of the agreement, as did the subsequent conduct relied on to establish the contravention (39 NSWLR at 166F-G). As Brennan and Dawson JJ noted in Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 344 (with whom Toohey J agreed at p 354) in respect of an arbitration clause that related to disputes 'arising out of' or relating to the agreement or the breach thereof (169 CLR at 337) '... the matter to be referred to arbitration cannot extend to issues which could not arise in proceedings between [the parties] or which are unrelated to the contract containing the arbitration clause: Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40-636 at 47,173'. In Union of India v EB Abby's Rederi AS ('The Evje') [1975] AC 797 Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, reasoned that a dispute was one 'arising out of' a charter party where the charter party contained a clause providing that general average was to be payable according to the York/Antwerp Rules 1950 and to be settled in London. He said that a disputed claim for general average contribution which might involve disputes concerning matters and questions referred to in that clause would essentially and clearly arise out of the charter party because the claim related to events during its operation ([1975] AC 807H-808B, 808G, Lord Reid at 804E, and Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed at 816C). Lord Salmon reasoned to similar effect ([1975] AC at 816F-8). In Ethiopian Oil Seed &amp; Pulses Export Corporation v Rio del Mar Foods Inc [1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 86 at 97, Hirst J took the view that the words 'arising out of' covered every dispute except a dispute as to whether there was ever a contract at all. He held that the words should be given a wide interpretation of that kind so as to give effect to the parties' presumed intention not to have two sets of proceedings. And, in Incitec Ltd v Alkimos Shipping Corporation [2004] FCA 698 ; (2004) 138 FCR 496 at 503-504 [32] - [37] Allsop J held that the clear tide of judicial opinion as to arbitration clauses, where the fair reading of them is not confined, was to give width, flexibility and amplitude to them (see [2004] FCA 698 ; 138 FCR 496 at 504 [36] ). Allsop J agreed with what French J had said about the construction issue in Paper Products Pty Ltd v Tomlinsons (Rochdale) Ltd (1993) 43 FCR 439. There, French J said of a clause providing for disputes 'arising under this agreement' that neither a trade practices claim nor claims for breach of warranty and negligent misstatement: '... can be said to arise out of the agreement. They all arise out of matters which are antecedent to the contract even though they may involve questions which also go to its performance. No authority has been cited to me which would support the wide construction of the clause contended for by Tomlinsons and certainly the natural meaning of the words does not support their extension to disputes arising out of matters antecedent to the agreement.' (43 FCR at 448) In my opinion French J's reasoning, although directed to a different form of words, is apposite here in respect of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims. In the The 'Playa Laga' [1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep 171 at 183, Stephenson and Ackner LJJ and Sir Sebag Shaw said that the words 'all disputes arising out of this contract' are less precise than they looked. They pointed out that in strictness disputes arise not out of a contract but out of conflicting views taken by the parties to the contract as Lord Sumner had said in Produce Brokers Co Ltd v Olympia Oil and Cake Co Ltd [1916] 1 AC 314 at 328. The English Court of Appeal said that there were two stages which must be gone through in order to achieve a solution, first consideration of what was the nature of the dispute and secondly whether that dispute was within the scope of the arbitration clause. Their Lordships, obiter, observed that where contractual and tortious disputes were so closely knitted together on the facts, that the agreement to arbitrate on one can probably be construed as covering the other, the dispute falls within the arbitration clause ([1983] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 183). And, in Allergan Pharmaceuticals Inc v Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc (1985) 7 ATPR SS40 -636 at 47,173-47,174 Beaumont J held that it was not enough to point to the contract as part of the background to allegations of contraventions of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). The latter causes of action arose pursuant to statute and existed independently of contract. He said that they were consumer protection provisions which in no way depended upon any private agreement for their source. And, conduct for the purposes of Pt V of that Act would be established, if at all, irrespective of the contractual relations with the immediate parties. Beaumont J said: 'In short, an alleged contravention of Pt V of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is not, as a matter of characterization, a ""controversy or claim arising out of or relating to (the) Agreement"" for the purposes of ... that contract.' I agree with Beaumont J's analysis. However, in Walter Rau Neusser Oel und Fett AG v Cross Pacific Trading Ltd [2005] FCA 1102 at [56] Allsop J suggested that the phrase 'arising out of' in an arbitration agreement reflected the practical, rather than theoretical, meaning to be given to the word 'contract' out of which disputes may arise. He said this could involve practical commercial considerations such as formation, extent and scope. Allsop J recognized that this wider construction was contrary to that of the Full Court in The 'Kuikang Career' (1998) 90 FCR 1 (see [2005] FCA 1102 [68]). I am of opinion that the Full Court's construction is correct for the reasons given above and in any event, like Allsop J, I am bound by it. Comandate Marine argued that the decision of the majority of the High Court in Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202 indicated that The 'Kiukiang Career' 90 FCR 1 was no longer good law and it should not be followed. I do not accept that argument. The construction of the operation of ss 82 and 86 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) with which Coventry v Charter Pacific Corporation Ltd [2005] HCA 67 ; (2005) 222 ALR 202 was concerned involved the rules for set off in bankruptcy and the statutory construction of the expression 'arising by reason of a contract'. Thus Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ held that a claim for damages for fraudulent misrepresentation brought by one contracting party against another or a claim for misleading or deceptive conduct which induced the party misled to make a contract with the other were, for the purposes of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth), claims 'arising by reason of a contract' (222 ALR at 219 [71]). The claim that misleading and deceptive conduct induced the entry into a contract necessarily was a claim which arose 'by reason of the contract', because if the thing complained of, namely the entry into the contract, had not occurred there would be no contract which could then be proved under s 82(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). Here, the claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) however, did not 'arise out of the contract', because that expression necessarily suggests that the contract was the source of the claim. Rather most of the essential elements of the cause of action under that Act existed before the contract came into existence, although elements of the performance of the contract, or non performance of the contract will have become relevant. Next Comandate Marine argued that a grant of the anti-anti-suit injunction to enable Pan to litigate its claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) amounted 'to the court aiding a party to commit a breach of contract'. The exercise by the Court of its jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to statutory powers where a party has engaged in conduct which is misleading or deceptive in breach of the statutory norms provided by the Parliament, is simply an instance of the Court enforcing the law. If Comandate Marine were found to have engaged in any misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), it would not be entitled to rely upon its strict contractual rights to defeat the statutory power of the Court to grant remedies to Pan flowing from that contravention. ESTOPPEL Comandate Marine argued that somehow an estoppel arose preventing Pan from denying that there was an agreement in writing for the purposes of Art II r 2 of the New York Convention. I do not understand how that could be. The facts are objective. The evidence of Mr Athanassiou and Capt Piperakis is perfectly clear that each of them recognized that there was no actual charter party document in final form in existence at the time contractual relations commenced between the parties and that such a document was to be brought into existence later (cf Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; (1954) 91 CLR 353 at 360). No conduct of Pan induced some other state of mind. There was nothing misleading and nothing unconscionable in Pan taking the stance it did about the matter. I see no substance in the argument. ANTI-ANTI-SUIT INJUNCTION Comandate Marine argued that I should not grant an injunction because it was in the public interest to hold parties to their contracts to arbitrate. I am of opinion that this argument ignores the fact that the Court's jurisdiction to give relief under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) is of considerable importance and reflects the public interest expressed in the enactment of statutes by the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia as laws that are to govern commercial behaviour in this country. I remain of the opinion I expressed in my earlier judgment ( Pan Australia Shipping Pty Ltd v The Ship 'Comandate' [2006] FCA 881). However, Comandate Marine, by its counsel, offered an undertaking to the Court that if it were found that s 7(2) of the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth) did not require a stay of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) claims, to consent to the London arbitration determining all issues raised between the parties under the latter Act in respect of any conduct of the parties to which that Act would apply as a matter of Australian law relating to formation and/or entry into of the charter and/or relating to the conduct of the parties in connection with the performance of the charter as being disputes within cl 45(b) and as part of the existing dispute referred to the London arbitration. Comandate Marine, by its counsel, also proffered an undertaking to the Court to agree that the arbitrators would have such jurisdiction, and it undertook not to prevent the arbitrators exercising that jurisdiction in determining the whole of the dispute between the parties. Pan does not want London arbitrators to determine its claim under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). Comandate's undertaking cannot extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrators. There is no power in s 7(2) to refer to arbitration or to stay claims under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) that do not otherwise fall within the agreement to arbitrate. The Court has power only to stay the proceedings to the extent that they relate to what is properly within the arbitration clause ( Tanning Research Laboratories Inc v O'Brien [1990] HCA 8 ; (1990) 169 CLR 332 at 344). While it may be convenient for the parties to have their whole dispute litigated in one forum, they cannot be forced to do so in a case like the present where the whole dispute does not arise out of the charter party. Given that there is now no dispute that Comandate Marine would seek to obtain against Pan an injunction from the High Court of Justice in England restraining its prosecution of these proceedings, if the whole dispute were not arbitrated in London, it seems to me that for the reasons that I gave on 22 June 2006 the injunction must be continued. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE RE WITNESSES Capt Piperakis said that there was a number of potential witnesses for the owners who were in Greece or elsewhere than in Australia. The Master and crew, when not at sea, might be located at various places in the northern hemisphere. The vessel's classification society representatives were in Greece, Singapore and Sri Lanka. The vessel had dry docked in Sri Lanka in December 2005 and there were also the ship's agent and surveyor located there. The owners' and charterers' Singapore agents may be needed together with the repairers in Singapore who repaired the vessel following a collision it had in Melbourne in June 2006. Capt Piperakis said that it would cause him personal and financial inconvenience to have to travel to Australia to attend a hearing in the matter whereas it would be relatively simple for him to travel to London. It is likely that quite a number of witnesses who will be required to be called are persons from Australia who will give evidence as to the observations by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Officers and others in the Australian ports as to the condition of the Comandate at various times together with Australian surveyors. It will also be likely that evidence will be called from witnesses based in Singapore and Sri Lanka as to the dry docking in Sri Lanka in 2005, the delivery and later repairs in Singapore this year. There may be some need for persons to come from Greece although I think that Capt Piperakis' evidence indicated that he was proceeding on an assumption that the existence of a contract at all may be in dispute. I do not think that that assumption is any longer correct, although it was certainly a matter that had been flagged by Pan in the interlocutory hearing on 22 June 2006. While the Master and crew are likely to be witnesses as to the vessel's condition, it will not make much difference where the hearing is so far as convenience to them is concerned. Wherever they are in the world either they will have to come away from whatever vessel they are on at the time or use electronic communication to give evidence at any hearing. The critical aspects of the claims of unseaworthiness and defective condition of the vessel together with the evidence as to the incurring of the damage to the hull are likely to be given by Australian witnesses and members of the ship's company. Pan had identified from the documents produced on subpoena at this early stage at least 12 different witnesses, 10 from the Authority, who may be required to give evidence. Of course, certain parts of the evidence may become uncontroversial as the case progresses but the impression I have is that leaving aside witnesses who will need to come from Sri Lanka and Singapore, on the material before me the likelihood is that most of the material witnesses other than the ship's company will be from Australia. There does not appear to be any relevant connection to London other than the requirement in cl 45(b) that the seat of the arbitration be there. CONCLUSION I order that Comandate Marine's motion be dismissed with costs. It follows that the interim injunction which I granted on 13 July 2006 until further order will continue undisturbed.

Case13034,cited,O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310,"In any event, the Minister submitted, it would not be in the interests of justice for this new ground to be entertained now because it had no prospect of success: see VAAC v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 74 ; (2003) 129 FCR 168 at [26] - [27] ; O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310 at 319; and Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1 at 7. The Minister submitted that the proposed ground contained nothing more than an unparticularised assertion that the RRT had ""totally ignored the requirements of s 36(2) read with s 422B"". Such a complaint was meaningless given that neither of these provisions imposed any mandatory obligations upon the RRT."
Case5947,distinguished,Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth and Another [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97,"As Black CJ and Moore J said in Save the Ridge Inc v Commonwealth and Another [2005] FCAFC 203 ; (2005) 147 FCR 97 (' Save the Ridge '), 105 at [19]: 'The apparent purpose of s 524 is to take the process of authorisation by governments or government agencies outside the purview of the EPBC Act by excluding certain decisions by those bodies from the concept of relevant ""action"".' 49 Forestry Tasmania is an agency of the State of Tasmania. It submits that as such it has granted to Gunns Limited ('Gunns') a 'governmental authorisation' under s 524(2) to conduct forestry operations in coupes 17E and 19D. It relies on Save the Ridge where a Full Court of this Court held that Ministerial approval and gazettal of changes to the National Capital Plan of the Australian Capital Territory, necessary to permit the construction of a road, was a decision of a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation to the Australian Capital Territory. Forestry Tasmania contends that an authorisation, when issued by a government body, will be a 'governmental authorisation when issued by the governmental body in its capacity as such' under s 524(2) of the EPBC Act. 50 Forestry Tasmania says the Forest Practices Plans for coupes 17E and 19D constitute the formal documents by which it authorised Gunns to conduct forestry operations. It submits that on this ground alone the application before the Court must fail. 51 The applicant contends that the submission of Forestry Tasmania referred to above depends on a characterisation of Forestry Tasmania's actions ('that is, logging, roading and the like') not as the physical activities involved, but as a product of a process where it authorises such activities to occur. 53 On this aspect of the proceeding, I prefer the applicant's submission. Save the Ridge is distinguishable because the attack in that case was on the steps taken to amend a plan which would authorise the construction of a freeway extension. There was no attack on the construction of the freeway extension. Here, there is no attack on a Forest Practices Plan, but on the work which is planned to take place under a Forest Practices Plan."
Case25015,distinguished,In re Dagnall Ex parte Soan &amp; Morley [1896] 2 QB 407 ,"The applicant relies upon a line of cases in bankruptcy commencing with In re Dagnall Ex parte Soan &amp; Morley [1896] 2 QB 407. Pursuant to the Married Women's Property Act 1982 , 'Every married woman carrying on a trade separately from her husband shall, in respect of her separate property, be subject to the bankruptcy laws in the same way as if she were a feme sole.' Mrs Dagnall had been carrying on a trade separately from her husband. Having sold her business, she gave notice to creditors that she was about to suspend payment of their debts. As a result a bankruptcy petition was presented. The question was whether or not the bankruptcy laws continued to apply to her after she had ceased trading but whilst she still owed trading debts. The Divisional Court (Vaughan Williams J and Wright J) found that the bankruptcy legislation continued to apply. Vaughan Williams J said (at 410-11): 'But whether a person is carrying on a trade or not is a question of fact; and if it were not for the decision in Ex parte McGeorge... , I would have said without any hesitation that as long as a woman trading separately from her husband had not paid the trade debts which she had incurred, so long she was continuing to trade. It seems to me that trading is not completed until you have performed all the obligations that the fact of trading imposed upon you. And that was the view that was taken in the older cases. Then we have to consider whether there is anything in the decision in Ex parte McGeorge... which prevents us from holding that the non-payment of debts incurred by a married woman while trading separately is evidence that she is still continuing to trade.' 24 His Lordship then referred to numerous ""older"" cases, noting that the decision in Ex parte McGeorge had departed from them on the basis of differences in the wording of the relevant bankruptcy legislation. Two alternative lines of reasoning emerge from his Lordship's brief judgment. The first is that a trader continues to trade until he or she has performed all obligations incurred as a result of such trading. The second is that non-payment of trading debts is evidence of continued trading, presumably to be considered in the light of other evidence. Wright J disposed of the matter on a different basis, holding (at 411) that: '... this appeal must be allowed, upon the short ground that in my view the natural meaning of the section is that a married woman who trades separately is to be subject to the bankruptcy laws in respect of all debts incurred by her in the period during which she was carrying on the trade.' 26 Those ""older cases"" are of some assistance in understanding the decision in Dagnall . In Meggot v Mills , 1 Ld Raym 286; 91 ER 1088, it was said that: '... though a man quits his trade, yet he may be a bankrupt for the debts that he owed before.' 29 In bankruptcy matters, Dagnall has been followed in Theophile v The Solicitor-General [1950] AC 186 at 201-203; In re Bird v Inland Revenue Commissioner [1962] 1 WLR 686 at 695-697 and In re a Debtor [1992] Ch 554. However, in Avondale Motors (Parts) Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1971] HCA 17 ; (1971) 124 CLR 97 at 102-103, Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) doubted the applicability of the decision in Dagnall 'beyond the field of bankruptcy and into that of taxation law' , referring to the decision of Tryka Ltd v Newall (1963) 41 TC 146 where Wilberforce J (as his Lordship then was) said: 'I do not think I can accept the application of the bankruptcy cases here. It seems to me that the two fields are quite different. When one is considering the question whether for purposes of bankruptcy laws a person is carrying on business, it may be necessary to hold that he does not cease to carry on business when trading activity has ceased, and for that reason, the Courts have been ready to extend the Section so as to cover a case where he has left debts unpaid. But to apply the same line of thought to Income Tax cases would lead to very great difficulties and, indeed, would mean that almost every case which one finds in the books on such questions as cessation of business would have been complicated by the introduction of this question and might, indeed, have been otherwise decided.' 38 One might well say that the railway company was in a position similar to that of the applicant prior to 25 June 2001. It had an interest in an asset, which was being managed by another party, and derived income from such interest. However the change in the undertaking of the railway company effected by the 1906 agreement was quite different from that made to the applicant's position by the agreement of 25 June 2001. The railway company's capital continued to be tied up in the railway, and it continued to derive income from that source. In the present case the applicant terminated its investment in the joint venture and ceased to derive income from it. Although Lord Sumner's reference to Dagnall may suggest some support for the applicant's case, the reference hardly amounted to an endorsement of the decision, and his Lordship clearly decided the case on its own facts. The other Law Lords made no reference to Dagnall . The applicant also refers to decisions applying the Dagnall-Theophile line of authorities in the Australian Taxation Board of Review and in Canada where Bowman CJ said: 'It is, I believe, settled law that a business continues to be carried on so long as the obligations arising out of the business remain unfulfilled ... .' 39 The cases cited in Dagnall and the reasons of Wright J do not support that proposition, even in the bankruptcy context. The rule is rather that, under bankruptcy legislation then in force, trading debts were recoverable in bankruptcy after trading had ceased. In Australia two eminent judges have doubted the wisdom of applying that proposition in the tax context, and a third (Brennan J) appears to have had a similar view. In England another eminent judge has expressed similar reservations. The decision in South Behar Railway cannot be interpreted as an endorsement of the wider application of the decision in Dagnall . Only one member of the House of Lords referred to it, and in a qualified way. Decisions in the Australian Taxation Board of Review can hardly be set against the views of the judges to whom I have referred. The observation in the Canadian case is not persuasive. In the circumstances I decline to follow Dagnall for present purposes."
Case19873,cited,City Link Melbourne Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2004] FCAFC 272 ; (2004) 141 FCR 69,"There is a large and in some respects not easily reconcilable body of case law on these questions: for a recent statement of some of the principles that are well settled, see City Link Melbourne Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) [2004] FCAFC 272 ; (2004) 141 FCR 69 at [27] - [29] ; and, on appeal, Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) v Citylink Melbourne [2006] HCA 35 at [122] ff.

Case20954,discussed,"Tisand Pty Limited v The Owners of the Ship MV ""Cape Moreton"" (Ex Freya) [2005] FCAFC 68 ; (2005) 143 FCR 43","Tisand Pty Limited v The Owners of the Ship MV ""Cape Moreton"" (Ex Freya) [2005] FCAFC 68 ; (2005) 143 FCR 43 Ryan and Allsop JJ, particularly at 68-74 [100]-[122] engaged in a substantial and learned discussion of the importance of identifying persons with a proprietary interest as owner or demise charterer in arrest proceedings, albeit that they concentrated on the question of ownership. They said that in ss 17 , 18 and 19 of the Act, the phrase ""the owner"" was used in a proprietary sense, reflecting the clear purpose of the Act to require that the property proposed to be arrested belong to the relevant person: The ""Cape Moreton"" 143 FCR at 73 [118]. Here, that approach must be adapted to the special provisions of s 18 in relation to a demise charterer being the relevant person. At the time of the arrest of the ""APC Aussie 1"" , T-D was the relevant person, as the existing demise charterer. T-D was the contracting party with EMAS under the charter for her towage. But, at the present time T-D is not capable of being a relevant person in respect of the barge because the demise charter has been terminated and APC Marine, as owner, has retaken possession. T-D now has no proprietary interest in the barge, yet EMAS is seeking to extend the ambit of the security for which the arrest was obtained to a cause of action not previously contemplated in either the writ or the amended writ. If granted, the amendment would have the effect of greatly expanding the amount of security that EMAS could require for release of the "" APC Aussie 1 "" before its owner would be able to exercise its proprietary rights, even though the new claim involves no direct relationship between EMAS and APC Marine. There may be occasions (that were not suggested during the hearing) in which it is possible to argue that such an amendment could be appropriate. It is for that reason that I do not wish to express a final view on this question and instead have exercised my discretion to refuse the application to amend. The reality is that EMAS seeks to utilise the earlier arrest of the barge, to bring pressure on APC Marine well after EMAS became aware of the existence of APC Marine's Singaporean writ and in circumstances in which EMAS has delayed making the application to amend until after the intervening event of APC Marine's termination of its charterparty with T-D."

The respondent Commissioner lodge with the Court and with the taxpayer applicants draft declarations and/or orders giving effect to the reasons for judgment within fourteen days, including orders as to costs. 29 Attention was further drawn by both parties to Rogers v The Queen [1994] HCA 42 ; (1994) 181 CLR 251 at 261, where Brennan J observed that: 'Although merger provides a distinction between res judicata and issue estoppel, both doctrines bind the parties and their privies to accept a final judicial decision of a question between the parties as correct'. The juridical notion of 'privies', or more perhaps precisely, privity in interest, was examined in Effem at first instance by Gummow J ( Trawl Industries of Australia Pty Limited (in liquidation) v Effem Foods Pty Limited (1992) 36 FCR 406). At 413-414, his Honour made the threshold observation that ' ... the doctrine of privity in interest... operates in the same way upon the doctrines of cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel... [t]he basic requirement of a privy in interest [being] that the privy must claim ""under or through"" the person to whom he is said to be a privy... [t[he necessary identity in interest may arise from a successive relationship in a temporal sense..., when finding the necessary privity, in a succussive or mutual relationship, the courts have looked to legal rather than economic indicia as the criterion of operation of the privity doctrine '. One example to which his Honour referred (at 414) was of holders of successive interests in the same fund, notwithstanding that they had become members of the fund subsequent to dismissal of proceedings brought by other beneficiaries. His Honour found that the applicant for relief in Effem ' ... was not claiming under or in virtue of any legal right of the other applicants in the present proceedings '. The taxpayer applicants' contended that there was an absence of satisfaction in the circumstances of this case of the requirement of privity of interest in relation to the respective claims of IEF and QTH on the one hand and that of Spassked on the other, implicitly notwithstanding that each was a wholly owned subsidiary of IEL, and moreover traced their ultimate corporate membership to the Adsteam Group. In any event, the taxpayer applicants contended in written submissions in reply as 'not disputed' that '[i]f Spassked and IEL are not estopped from pursuing appeals in other years that their privies cannot be estopped', but whether the converse of that proposition is true may be another matter, depending upon the scope of the doctrinal notions of privy and privity of interest."
Case7066,applied,Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564,It is well established that this provision is not breached by a failure to deal with every argument that has been raised or with every possibility. It is enough that the findings and reasons deal with the substantial issues upon which the decision turned and that they do so in a way which clearly exposes the reasoning process: Dornan v Riordan (1990) 24 FCR 564 at 567-568; Hawkins v Comcare [2001] FCA 726 ; (2001) 115 FCR 127 at [60] .
Case7279,applied,Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427,"to the first limb, it is to be noted that s 52(4) and (5) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) provide as follows: (4) A creditor's petition lapses at the expiration of: (a) subject to paragraph (b), the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of the petition; or (b) if the Court makes an order under subsection (5) in relation to the petition &#8212; the period fixed by the order; unless, before the expiration of whichever of those periods is applicable, a sequestration order is made on the petition or the petition is dismissed or withdrawn. (5) The Court may, at any time before the expiration of the period of 12 months commencing on the date of presentation of a creditor's petition, if it considers it just and equitable to do so, upon such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, order that the period at the expiration of which the petition will lapse be such period, being a period exceeding 12 months and not exceeding 24 months, commencing on the date of presentation of the petition as is specified in the order. Order 35 r 7(3) of the Federal Court Rules provides as follows: A clerical mistake in a judgment or order, or an error arising in a judgment order from an accidental slip or omission, may at any time be corrected by the Court. Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 (Cth), it may be noted, provides that the Federal Magistrates Court may apply the Federal Court Rules where, in a particular case, the 2001 Rules are "" insufficient or inappropriate "". By reason of the terms of Rule 1.05 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules , no question arises as to a Federal Magistrate not being clothed with authority to invoke O 35 r 7: Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 at [37] to [41] [2008] FCA 427 ; , 246 ALR 175 at 181 to 182 per Lindgren J. Section 52(5), it has been observed, is in some ways comparable to the statutory requirement that a company be wound up within six months of an application being made. And in Elyard Corporation Pty Ltd v DDB Needham Sydney Pty Ltd (1995) 61 FCR 385 consideration was given to whether that statutory requirement displaced the "" slip rule "". That decision has since been applied in the context of bankruptcy proceedings in Griffiths v Boral Resources (Qld) Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 149 , 154 FCR 554. Spender ACJ, Dowsett and Collier JJ there observed as follows: [29] The decision of the Full Court in Re Young; ex parte Smith (1985) 5 FCR 204 establishes that there can be no extension pursuant to s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act once the petition has lapsed. However the Court (of which Lockhart J was a member) considered that there was no question of applying the slip rule in that case (at 209). In Elyard the Court addressed the slip rule, but in the context of winding up rather than bankruptcy. Although s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act serves substantially the same purpose as s 459R of the Corporations Act , there are potentially significant differences between the two sections. [30] With all respect, we are a little uncomfortable with the view, inherent in Elyard , that the slip rule may be used to extend time notwithstanding the statutory requirement that such order be made within a period of time which has elapsed. However Elyard concerns the practice of the Court and has now stood for over ten years without legislative intervention. We are reluctant to reconsider it. Although it does not directly bind us in applying s 52 of the Bankruptcy Act , to take a different approach would cause substantial confusion in insolvency practice. [31] We wish to stress, however, the importance of the policy, evidenced in both the Corporations Act and the Bankruptcy Act , that insolvency proceedings be speedily resolved, presumably for commercial reasons and for reasons of fairness. Courts exercising jurisdiction in insolvency must recognise this policy by giving priority to the hearing and determination of such matters. The parties and their legal advisers, particularly those advising petitioning creditors, must be aware of the potential problem. The decision in Elyard should not be taken as establishing an unlimited power to avoid this statutory policy. As also noted by their Honours, the question as to whether there was any "" error "" which attracted the power to invoke the "" slip rule "" is a question of fact: [2006] FCAFC 149 at [68] . With respect, the same reservation is also expressed as to ability to correct an "" error "" pursuant to O 35 r 7 by extending the duration of a petition in the face of the express statutory terms of s 52(5). Notwithstanding that reservation, it is the case that other authorities have endorsed the existence of a power to extend time after the initial 12 month period has expired and where there has been an accidental slip or omission in failing to make an application within the time prescribed by s 52(5): Matthews v Collett [2000] FCA 224 ; Bankstown Grammar School Ltd v Park [2000] FCA 1205 ; Roskell v Snelgrove [2008] FCA 427 , 246 ALR 175 ; Boumelhem v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2008] FCA 1568 , 171 FCR 462."

Case80,cited,Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355,"I should indicate that even if I came to the conclusion that there was a failure to adhere to a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, I would not consider that such failure would vitiate the decision to remove or suspend. I readily accept that the Act has given express and considerable prominence to the role of the local Aboriginal communities, and that the Act envisages that consultation with such communities be undertaken in defined circumstances. However, I must look at the power here being exercised, which is not one of appointment, but of suspension and removal. Such powers may need to be exercised in a variety of circumstances, without there necessarily being any relevance in seeking the views of local Aboriginal communities, such as for instance if a particular inspector was considered no longer to be a fit and proper person. I do not accept that the input of the local Aboriginal community is of the same significance in circumstances of suspension or removal, or that consultation would be regarded as an essential or mandatory requirement to effect a suspension or removal. If necessary to decide, I would take the view that if there was a requirement of consultation with a local Aboriginal community prior to suspension or removal, breach of that requirement would not lead to the invalidity of such a suspension or removal: see generally Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 ; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 388-391; and Bond v WorkCover Corporation (SA) (2005) 93 SASR 315 at 331-336."
Case523,followed,Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323,"Consistent with the legislative objective sought to be achieved by s 40(1)(g) , it has been held that the phrase "" could not have been set up "" refers to a "" cross-claim, set-off or cross demand "" which could not have been set up as a matter of law; a mere failure to take advantage of an opportunity to do so does not fall within s 40(1)(g): Re Vicini; Ex parte E A Sealey &amp; Co (1982) 64 FLR 323. Fisher J there usefully summarised as follows some of the relevant authorities (at 326): The relevant words of the Act were considered by Lockhart J in Re Brink; Ex parte The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Ltd. (1980) 44 FLR 135, at p 139, when he said: ""The words 'that he could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained' mean 'which he could not by law set up in the action': see Re Jocumsen (1929) 1 ABC 82 , at p 85; Re A Debtor [1914] 3 KB 726, at p 730 per Avory J.; Re Stockvis (1934) 7 ABC 53 , at p 57, especially per Lukin J where his Honour said: 'I take as a counterclaim, set off or cross demand which could not be set up as one which, from point of time, or from its nature, or from absence of empowering provisions, or from positive inhibition so to do, could not be set up in the particular case in which judgment was obtained ... . Mere failure to take advantage of the opportunity can hardly be said to be inability.'"" In Re A Debtor the circumstances were that, at the time of judgment, the debtor was not the assignee of a debt, which debt he in answer to the bankruptcy notice relied upon as constituting a counterclaim which he could not have set up in the proceedings. Thus at the time of judgment he could not have as a matter of law set up the counterclaim. It was nothing to the point that he might have earlier taken an assignment. At p 730 Avory J said: ""I think that upon the true interpretation of the section a debtor is entitled to set up in answer to a bankruptcy notice a counter-claim which rebus sic stantibus he could not in law have set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained, even though he could, if he had chosen, have taken steps which would have rendered the counter-claim available to him in the action. ""I think it means a counter-claim which as things then stood the debtor could not set up in the action."" The judgment debtor was there asserting that, despite his best endeavours, he could not obtain "" factual and expert evidence "" to establish his counterclaim. That was not sufficient to bring himself within s 40(1)(g). Fisher J concluded (at 326): In my opinion these statements of principle... determine the matter against the debtor. There was no reason in law why he could not set up his counterclaim in the creditor's proceedings. ...

Case39,considered,Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561,"In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Pegasus Leveraged Options Group Pty Ltd (2002) 41 ACSR 561 at 574 ("" Pegasus ""), Davies AJ addressed the question whether the sole director of the company which promoted and operated a managed investment scheme should also be considered to be a person operating the scheme. His Honour said at [55]-[57]: ""The word 'operate' is an ordinary word of the English language and, in the context, should be given its meaning in ordinary parlance. The term is not used to refer to ownership or proprietorship but rather to the acts which constitute the management of or the carrying out of the activities which constitute the managed investment scheme. The Oxford English Dictionary gives these relevant meanings: 5. To effect or produce by action or the exertion of force or influence; to bring about, accomplish, work. 6. To cause or actuate the working of; to work (a machine, etc). Chiefly U.S. 7. To direct the working of; to manage, conduct, work (a railway, business, etc); to carry out or through, direct to an end (a principle, an undertaking, etc) orig. U.S. I have concluded that Mr McKim operated the managed investment scheme. He was the living person who formulated and directed the scheme and he was actively involved in its day to day operations. He supervised others in their performance. I have also concluded that Mr McKim is not exempted by s601ED(6). He did not 'merely' act as agent or employee of Pegasus. He was the directing mind and will of Pegasus and of the scheme."" 35 Mansfield J reached a similar conclusion in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488. In that case, the individual in question was one of the directors of the company managing the scheme. His Honour found that the person in question formulated and directed the scheme, and was actively involved in its day to day operations as the directing mind and will of the company managing the scheme. Accordingly, he was operating the scheme in contravention of s 601EB(5). In making these findings, Mansfield J approved the passage in Pegasus to which I have referred. 55 Since Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW ) [1981] HCA 49 ; (1981) 148 CLR 121, esp at 125, the courts have recognised that the grant of declaratory relief on the application of a statutory body such as ASIC may serve important law enforcement purposes: see Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 at 603; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney [2001] NSWSC 114 at [30] - [31] ; and Pegasus at 571. ASIC is charged with the administration and enforcement of the Act , and there will be many cases where it is in the public interest for the courts to make a declaration on ASIC's application that the Act has been contravened in specified respects. The making of such a declaration does not simply record the outcome of enforcement proceedings; it may also be an appropriate way of marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct: see Tobacco Institute of Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (No 2) (1993) 41 FCR 80 at 97-99, 106 and 110. 77 ASIC does not seek an order that BTS be wound up, even though there is some evidence that it might be insolvent. In many cases, it may be appropriate, and it may further investor protection, to make winding up orders in respect of both the unregistered managed investment scheme and the company which administered the scheme: see Pegasus at 579-580, at [95] [98]. Indeed, in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778 at 796, Owen J said at [93] that if an unregistered scheme is to be wound up, the case for a liquidation of the company that conducted it is compelling."
Case1366,cited,Gutwenger v Commissioner of Taxation (1995) 55 FCR,"However, the fact that in realising the asset the taxpayer has engaged in activities which were planned, organised and coherent, and which produced profits considerably more than could otherwise have been obtained, does not mean that an advantageous realisation converts into a profit-making scheme: Scottish Australian Mining Co v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1950] HCA 16 ; (1950) 81 CLR 188, Gibbs CJ in Whitford's Beach 150 CLR at 369.

Case2409,followed,Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599,"J has on two occasions expressed a different view: see Clinique Laboratories v Luxury Skincare Brands Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 1517 ; (2003) 61 IPR 130 at [132] and Pfizer Products Inc v Karam [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [6] - [26] ( Pfizer ). His Honour considered the higher Lomas standard in some detail in Pfizer . After an exhaustive review of the authorities, and noting that the observations in Lomas itself were ""plainly obiter dicta without the benefit of argument"", his Honour stated at [21]: The fundamental difficulty with [the respondent's] argument is that it is inconsistent with the language of s 55. Whether a ground of opposition has been ""established"" is a conventional concept requiring no particular elucidation. In my opinion, there is no basis upon which the section can be read as ""the extent (if any) to which any ground on which the application was opposed has been clearly established"", particularly where that implication changes the practical operation of the section by imposing a special high onus of proof. It is also worth noting that the construction favoured in Torpedoes is not rooted in the words of the section at all. The precise finding in that case was that the opposition ""should be upheld only if the court is satisfied that the trade mark should clearly not be registered"": at [22]. With all respect, that test is not to be found in the statute. I cannot find anything in the structure or content of other provisions of the 1995 Act that would point to reading s 55 other than according to its ordinary meaning. Guylian did not seek to justify in a substantive way the approach of the Full Court in Lomas . It sought to rely on the decision, and those that have followed it, but it acknowledged that other decisions run counter to it. In my view, there is nothing in the relevant provisions that supports the imposition of a higher standard, even at the acceptance stage. The ""presumption of registrability"" arises from s 33 of the Act: Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [24] ; Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 at [50] . Section 33 does not speak of being ""clearly satisfied""; it mandates acceptance of an application unless the Registrar "" is satisfied that ... there are grounds for rejecting it"". On this point, I prefer the views expressed by Gyles J and in particular his Honour's observations that an acceptance that there is a presumption of registrability ""says nothing as to the standard of proof"" and does not import a higher threshold than the conventional balance of probabilities: see Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [18] . The presumption as it is gives effect to the general position under the Act that an applicant is not required to establish an absence of grounds to refuse or object to registration. It should also be noted that in both Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 and Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 (both acceptance stage cases) there is no suggestion that any special higher standard was applicable."
Case13213,considered,Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347,"J, when dealing with a case involving the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) and the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 (Cth) in Re Ditfort; Ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCR 347, decided that the Federal Court could consider as a 'justiciable matter' an allegation by the Deputy Commissioner that false statements had been made by the Australian government to the German government. The issue of the relationship between the governments was raised in the course of the Court's exercising jurisdiction under the Bankruptcy Act . In that case, his Honour embarked on the issue and had regard to diplomatic notes (' notes verbales ') exchanged between the two governments. After reviewing the authorities relating to justiciability, his Honour observed at 369 that in Australia, one looks not to the traditionally recognised content of the prerogative power, as in Britain, but rather to s 61 of the Constitution , which vests the executive power of the Commonwealth in the Crown. He noted that the executive power extends to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth, thus enabling the Crown to undertake all executive action appropriate to areas of responsibility vested in the Commonwealth. One of these areas is the conduct of international relations and the acquisition of international rights and obligations. Accordingly, the Court can adjudicate on matters going to restraints on and the extent and nature of the executive power as a constitutional question. In such a case, no problem of non-justiciability will arise. His Honour continues at 369 by pointing out that questions as to the character and extent of the powers of the executive government in relation to the conduct of international relations may give rise to a matter which involves the interpretation of s 61 of the Constitution , and consequently will affect the interests of a plaintiff so as to afford him or her standing. Where this is so, there is subject matter for the exercise of federal jurisdiction and no question of non-justiciability will ordinarily arise. His Honour observed that dealings between the governments of Australia and foreign states will not normally, in the absence of legislation, create rights for or impose obligations on Australian citizens, and that a breach of Australia's international obligations, of itself, would not be a matter justiciable at the suit of a private citizen. It is to be noted that these observations are carefully worded so as to not foreclose argument in exceptional circumstances. His Honour said at 370: '... there will be no ""matter"" [on which the Court can adjudicate] if the plaintiff seeks an extension of the Court's true function into a domain that does not belong to it, namely the consideration of undertakings and obligations depending entirely on political sanctions.' He refers, by way of an example of such political questions, to agreements and understandings between Australian and foreign governments. Mr Hicks refers to these principles and submits that s 61 of the Constitution confers power on the executive to protect citizens overseas. He submits that the adjudication of the legality of actions of the executive is amenable to the Chapter III courts and the fact that those powers are exercised in relation to some aspect of foreign affairs or diplomatic negotiations does not automatically exclude the conduct of the Government from review by Chapter III courts. The question for a Chapter III court is whether the proceeding requires the extension of the court's jurisdiction into areas political in nature such that it has no legal guidelines or criteria against which to make its determination. Rather than exclude certain areas such as foreign relations totally from judicial review, Mr Hicks submits that the proper approach is to carefully examine the particular grounds of review raised on which the specific relief is based. In the present case, the applicant submits in relation to the ground of judicial review that extraneous or irrelevant considerations have influenced the decision of the Executive not to request the return of Mr Hicks to Australia. As a consequence, that decision should be set aside and the Executive ordered to consider the question in accordance with law."
Case17929,cited,Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 (2003) 131 FCR 28,"There are perhaps greater difficulties in relation to the questions of bias and discrimination. There is little doubt that a denial of procedural fairness can amount to an error of law on the part of the Tribunal, and that the Court can receive evidence and make findings of fact in relation to such a denial. See Clements v Independent Indigenous Advisory Committee [2003] FCAFC 143 (2003) 131 FCR 28 at [3] - [13] per Gray ACJ and North J. There is also little doubt that the Tribunal is bound by the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (""the Racial Discrimination Act "") and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth). Under the latter, of course, before a proceeding is taken in Court in respect of a complaint of discrimination, including a complaint of discrimination under the Racial Discrimination Act , it is necessary to make that complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and to have the certificate of the Commission before the proceeding can be commenced in the Court. To the extent, therefore, that the applicant seeks to rely on those Acts, there is nothing to show that the proceeding is properly within the jurisdiction of this Court. 14 The orders that the applicant seeks in the notice of appeal, with the exception of the awarding of costs to the applicant for the proceeding in this Court if he should succeed, are manifestly orders that the Court could not make. The question whether the Social Security Appeals Tribunal decision should be set aside is a question entirely for the Tribunal and would not activate this Court's jurisdiction at all. For the Court to order that the Tribunal set aside the earlier decision would be for the Court itself to engage in merits review in a proceeding which can only be on a question of law. An order that the Tribunal apologise for racial discrimination would also be beyond the power of the Court, at least without a complaint having been lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as a preliminary to the proceeding in this Court. An order that the Tribunal award costs of the proceeding in the Tribunal to the applicant is likewise beyond the power of the Court. 15 The end result, it seems to me, is that if the applicant wishes to raise any question of bias on the part of the Tribunal, his obligation is to await the conclusion of the proceeding in the Tribunal. If he were to be successful in that proceeding, of course, he would have no right of appeal on the question of bias, and would be bound in any event to fail. If he were to fail in that proceeding, it would then be open to him to pursue, by way of appeal to this Court, any question of bias on the part of the Tribunal. In my view, I am bound by the authorities that say that, with limited exceptions, a decision for the purposes of s 44(1) of the AAT Act is only a final decision."
Case13272,applied,Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd (1997) 138 FLR 417,"It is now well settled that, if a s 459G application and affidavit are not filed and served within the time so specified, the Court has no power to extend the period for the making of such an application: see Aussie Vic Plant Hire at [3]; David Grant &amp; Co Pty Limited (rec apptd) v Westpac Banking Corporation (1995) 184 CLR 265. In the present matter, the statutory demand was served on Dromana on 29 November 2007. The application to set it aside was filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria on 20 December 2007. It was not served on Mr Gryst until 21 December 2007. In consequence, that application was not one made ""in accordance with section 459G"" of the Act. The emphatic language of s 459G(3) admits of no other conclusion: see Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd (1997) 138 FLR 417; Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Tixana Pty Ltd (2003) 202 ALR 401 ; Hardel Property Holdings Pty Ltd v Allmark Property Management Pty Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 122 at [1]. While counsel for the plaintiff has sought to avoid this conclusion by recourse to ""purposive legislation"", the Parliament, in my view, has spoken on this matter with unmistakeable clarity. 13 The date the s 459P winding up application was made was 10 June 2008. For the purposes of s 459C(2)(a) the presumption of insolvency could only arise if in the period three months prior to that date, i.e. on or after 10 March 2008, Dromana failed to comply with a statutory demand. Dromana did not fail to comply with the statutory demand during that period. In consequence, Mr Gryst cannot rely on the presumption of insolvency in prosecuting his winding up application as s 459C(2)(a) has not been enlivened in the circumstances: see Pinn v Barroleg Pty Ltd and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Tixana Pty Ltd with which decisions I respectfully agree."
Case19960,cited,Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507,"I will enumerate the propositions as follows:- (1) The object of estoppel in pais is to prevent an unjust or unconscionable departure by one person from an assumption adopted by another as the basis of an act or omission which, unless the assumption is adhered to, would operate to the other's detriment: Thompson v Palmer [1933] HCA 61 ; (1933) 49 CLR 507 ("" Thompson "") at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt v Great Boulder Pty Limited (1937) 59 CLR 640 ("" Grundt "") at 674 per Dixon J; Legione at 430 431; Waltons at 413 per Brennan J; Verwayen at 409 per Mason CJ and at 500 per McHugh J. (2) Whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption: Thompson at 547 per Dixon J; Grundt at 675-676; Legione at 431 432; Waltons at 404 per Mason CJ, Wilson J; Verwayen at 444 per Deane J and at 500 per McHugh J. (3) Accordingly, the reference to an ""unjust"" departure is not a charter for idiosyncratic concepts of justice and fairness: Legione at 431. That is to say, it requires the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party caused him or her to adopt the assumption. (4) The party asserting an estoppel must establish that he or she has relied upon the assumption and that detriment flows from the reliance; that is to say, if the assumption were not adhered to: Grundt at 674 675; Waltons at 413 and Verwayen at 415. (5) It may be possible to divide detriment into the ""narrower"" and ""broader"" sense, although this approach, which was stated by Mason CJ in Verwayen at 415, really points to the distinction between reliance and detriment. The narrower sense is reliance on the assumption, whilst the broader sense is the detriment which flows from reliance on the deserted assumption. It is avoidance of the broader or ""real detriment"" flowing from reliance, from which the law seeks to protect the party who has changed his or her position: Grundt at 674 per Dixon J; Verwayen at 415 per Mason CJ. (6) It is only when the party sought to be estopped wishes to disavow the assumption that an estoppel arises and the question of detriment then falls to be considered: see P Feltham et al (2004) Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation (4 th ed) Butterworths, London at [V5.9] and Grundt at 674-675. (7) Although detriment in the broad sense is required to found an estoppel, the remedy the law provides will often be closer in scope to the detriment suffered in the narrower sense, that is to say, reliance: Verwayen at 415 416 per Mason CJ. (8) Avoidance of the detriment may require the party estopped to make good the assumption but this will depend on all the circumstances including the consideration that no more may be required than is necessary to avoid the detriment: see the discussion of Verwayen in Giumelli at [40] [48]. (9) The burden of proof of reliance and detriment lies upon the person asserting an estoppel: Thompson at 549 per Dixon CJ and Verwayen at 416 per Mason CJ. Dixon J's reference in Thompson at 549 to the shift of the burden of proof cannot have been intended to negate the principle stated by his Honour later in that paragraph, ie that the burden lies with the plaintiff. It can only have been intended to be a reference to the shifting evidentiary burden once some evidence of detriment is established: see J D Heydon (2004) Cross on Evidence (7 th ed) LexisNexis Butterworth, Sydney at [7205], [7225]. (10) Estoppel by convention requires proof of an assumption adopted by the parties as the conventional basis of their relationship: Thompson at 547; Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Limited v Norwich Winterthur Insurance (Australia) Limited [1986] HCA 14 ; (1986) 160 CLR 226 ("" Con-Stan "") at 244. (11) The proposition that the necessary foundation for an estoppel by convention must be an assumed state of facts presently in existence, as stated by the High Court in Con-Stan at 244 245, has been qualified by later authority. The assumed state of affairs may extend to an assumption of law: Eslea Holdings Limited v Butts (1986) 6 NSWLR 175 at 186-189 per Samuels JA; Waltons at 415 and Verwayen at 413 per Dixon J, 445 per Deane J, and at 501 per McHugh J. (12) An estoppel by convention, unlike estoppel by representation, depends upon mutual assumptions. It is consensual in nature and is founded upon an agreed or mutually assumed state of facts (or law): Con-Stan at 244. (13) Conventional estoppel does not extend to assumptions concerning future matters. But an assumption as to a future right may found an equitable estoppel, in particular a promissory estoppel: Waltons at 398 399 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 459 per Gaudron J and Verwayen at 499 500 per McHugh J. (14) The necessary elements of equitable or promissory estoppel are stated in the following passage from the judgment of Brennan J in Waltons at 428 429:- ""In my opinion, to establish an equitable estoppel, it is necessary for a plaintiff to prove that (1) the plaintiff assumed that a particular legal relationship then existed between the plaintiff and the defendant or expected that a particular legal relationship would exist between them and, in the latter case, that the defendant would not be free to withdraw from the expected legal relationship; (2) the defendant has induced the plaintiff to adopt that assumption or expectation; (3) the plaintiff acts or abstains from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation; (4) the defendant knew or intended him to do so; (5) the plaintiff's action or inaction will occasion detriment if the assumption or expectation is not fulfilled; and (6) the defendant has failed to act to avoid that detriment whether by fulfilling the assumption or expectation or otherwise."" (15) In order to found an estoppel between parties who are in contractual negotiations, it is necessary for the party asserting the estoppel to prove that the other party induced him or her to believe that the other's freedom to withdraw has gone; that is to say, there must be an expectation that the other party is bound to proceed. This is reflected in the first of the six principles stated by Brennan J above and in the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General (Hong Kong) v Humphreys Estate (Queen's Gardens) Limited [1987] 1 AC 114 ("" Humphreys ""). (16) The adoption of any assumption or expectation by the party asserting the estoppel must be reasonable in all the circumstances: Waltons at 406 per Mason CJ and Wilson J, Verwayen at 414 per Mason CJ and at 445 per Deane J and Standard Chartered Bank Aust Limited v Bank of China (1991) 23 NSWLR 164 at 180 per Giles J. (17) A representation or conduct relied upon as founding an estoppel must be clear and unambiguous: Legione at 435 437, Foran v Wight [1989] HCA 51 ; (1989) 168 CLR 385 at 410 411 per Mason J, and Mobil Oil Australia Limited v Wellcome International Pty Limited (1998) 81 FCR 475 ("" Mobil Oil "") at 513 per Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ; see also Spencer Bower's Law Relating to Estoppel by Representation at [V111.4.1]. (18) A corollary of the requirement of certainty is that it is a necessary element of the principle that the defendant has created or encouraged an assumption that ""a particular legal relationship"" or ""interest"" would arise or be granted: Mobil Oil at 513. (19) A pre-existing contractual relationship is not, under Australian law, a prerequisite to the application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel: Waltons at 399 403 per Mason CJ and Wilson J and 428 429 per Brennan J and Verwayen at 455 per Dawson J. (20) A person who is led to believe that he or she will be granted an interest in land and who acts to his or her detriment in that belief will be entitled to an interest in the land in accordance with the following statement of principle enunciated by Lord Kingsdown in his dissenting judgment in Ramsden v Dyson at 170:- ""If a man, under a verbal agreement with a landlord for a certain interest in land, or, what amounts to the same thing, under an expectation created or encouraged by the landlord that he shall have a certain interest, takes possession of such land with the consent of the landlord, and upon the faith of such promise or expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, lays out money upon the land, a Court of equity will compel the landlord to give effect to such promise or expectation."" (21) Lord Kingsdown's statement of principle was approved by the Privy Council in Plimmer v Mayor of Wellington (1884) 9 AC 699 ("" Plimmer"") at 710 and again in Humphreys at 121: see also the analysis of the authorities by Priestley JA in Austotel Pty Limited v Franklins Selfserve Pty Limited (1989) 16 NSWLR 582 ("" Austotel "") at 604 610. Priestley JA's distillation of the principles has been accepted as cogent: Mobil Oil at 512. (22) Subject to a qualification stated below, it is not necessary that the interest to the secured under the Ramsden v Dyson or Plimmer principle be expressly stated or that the terms of the arrangement or understanding to secure that interest be sufficiently certain to be enforceable as a contract. The Court must look at the circumstances of each case to determine the form of relief: Plimmer at 713 714, Inwards v Baker [1965] 2 QB 29 at 37, and Austotel at 607 610 per Priestley JA. (23) The qualification is that where the parties have not reached agreement as to the contractual terms necessary to establish the interest in the land, the Court will exercise caution in coming to a conclusion that it would be unconscionable to prevent a party from insisting upon its strict legal rights: Austotel at 585 586 per Kirby JA and at 620 621 per Rogers AJA. 672 Here the question is whether there has been an unjust departure by one person, that is to say QR, ""from an assumption adopted by another [ie NRC]"" as the basis for NRC's decision to make the investment decisions to which I have referred: see Thompson at 547. 673 Thus, although as I have said at [62], Messrs Butcher, Moore-Wilton and Stanko and Mrs Yeoh gave evidence in general terms that they relied on Mr Graham, it seems to me to be necessary to look at the evidence of their deliberations to see whether this was consistent with the approach taken by Mr Graham. I do not consider that reliance in general terms can be sufficient in circumstances where the individual directors gave evidence of their own approaches to the matter. 693 It follows that of the four pleaded assumptions, only the second assumption finds any support in the evidence. But the only evidence to support it was that of Mr Graham and his approach was inconsistent with that of the other directors. In my opinion this does not establish that NRC adopted the assumption as the basis for the relevant actions within the principle stated by Dixon J in Thompson . 744 As Dixon J said in Thompson at 547, whether a departure from an assumption is unjust depends upon the part taken by the person sought to be estopped in occasioning the adoption by the other party of the assumption. 745 Even if the assumptions propounded by PN are capable in their terms of giving rise to an estoppel, the claim fails because QR did nothing to occasion or cause the adoption of the assumption. 746 Mr Graham formed his assumptions based upon his reading of the EA. He did not put forward any positive statement or conduct by Mr O'Rourke or, to the extent that Mr Hamill's conduct is, or may, be relevant, any positive statement or conduct of Mr Hamill. Instead he emphasised that nothing said by either of those persons in the period from 1992 to March 1997 was inconsistent with Mr Graham's understanding of the EA. 865 The claim of lost opportunity to apply political pressure is, to borrow from the words of Starke J in Thompson at 528, at best ""wholly speculative and conjectural"" and affords ""no solid basis"" for concluding that NRC acted to its detriment. 866 The same may be said of the suggestion that NRC lost the opportunity to avail itself of the alternative dispute resolution provisions of cl 7 of the EA. Not only did NRC fail to invoke the clause, but as I have already said, the clause did not provide a mechanism for determination of the form or the terms of the rights to be accorded to NRC. 867 There were three species of operational detriment identified by PN. The first was generalised evidence of the adverse effect on future operating conditions at the AR terminal given, in particular, by Mr Fullerton. The second was said to be the comparison between PN's existing cost of operations and the price to be charged by QR under the Terminal Services Agreement. This proposition was put to QR's CEO, Mr Scheuber, in cross-examination."
Case24833,cited,Hughes (trading as Crowded Planet) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 319,"After considering the proposed orders, the history of this matter, and the submissions of Counsel I am satisfied that the orders proposed by the parties in relation to the contempt charges are appropriate in the circumstances. My reasons are as follows: 1. I accept the applicant's submissions in relation to withdrawing the charges against the first respondent. I note that the first respondent is in liquidation, and the submission in Court on Monday by Mr Aggs, liquidator of the first respondent, that the first respondent is insolvent. I accept the proposition that, in these circumstances, pursuit of the first respondent, which is a corporate entity, is pointless. There are no funds to satisfy any orders, for example, for a fine or costs. It is therefore appropriate for the Court to grant leave to the applicant to withdraw these charges. 2. I accept the applicant's submissions as to withdrawing the charges against the fifth respondent, in light of his age, his role in the conduct the subject of the applicant's claims, and the concession by the applicant as to the evidence against him. 3. I note that the second, third and fourth respondent have pleaded guilty, which is an issue to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentence ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 293). I note also the submission of Mr Atkinson for the second, third and fourth respondents that, in pleading guilty, the respondents have avoided the need for two trials, each of which was estimated to be four to five weeks, and have therefore relieved the resources of both the Court and the applicant (cf NW Foods 71 FCR at 291). 4. In this case, the second, third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty to a statement of charge alleging deliberate and repeated instances of contempt of the orders of Cooper J. Given the nature of the contempt, a significant penalty is in order. 5. The Courts have generally accepted that a term of imprisonment is appropriate only in the most serious criminal contempt cases: R v Fletcher; Ex parte Kisch [1935] HCA 1 ; (1935) 52 CLR 248 at 257 per Evatt J, Gallagher v Durack [1983] HCA 2 ; (1983) 152 CLR 238. In this case the proposal of the parties that the third and fourth respondents be sentenced to six months imprisonment, albeit suspended, is at the high end of the range of penalty for contempt, particularly as it is common ground that the respondents had not previously been found by the Court to have acted in contempt. However, the serious nature of the contempt charges in this case, to which the second, third and fourth respondents have pleaded guilty, in my view warrants the prospect of a period of imprisonment. 6. The Federal Court is empowered to impose a sentence of imprisonment for contempt of court, to be suspended on conditions including as to length of time of the suspension: Hughes (trading as Crowded Planet) v Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission [2004] FCAFC 319 at [56] . In the case before me, the proposal that the sentence of six months be suspended for two years is consistent with other decisions involving similarly serious contempts of court (cf Hughes [2004] FCAFC 319 at [57] ). 7. In my view, however, while the sentence is at the higher range, it is not so high as to be oppressive ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 293, cf Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Matthews (2001) 39 ACSR 110 where the contemnor was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, suspended for two years and the Court similarly found that the sentence was not so high as to be oppressive). 8. I note the parties jointly propose that the period of imprisonment of the third and fourth respondents be suspended. In this context however I note that the applicant in this case is the State regulator in the field of consumer protection. It is appropriate to accord weight to the views of the regulator, in particular as to the deterrent quality both for the respondents and for others who may be disposed to engage in conduct of a similar kind ( NW Foods 71 FCR at 292, Mobil Oil [2004] FCAFC 72 at [79] ). 9. Although the award of costs is at the discretion of the Court, commonly in contempt cases there is a link between the award of indemnity costs and the penalty, where the award of costs is in lieu of a fine: Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v BHP Steel (AIS) Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 13 per Moore J at [8]-[12]. In this case the proposed orders do not include a fine to be paid by the second, third and fourth respondents, however they do impose an obligation on these respondents to pay a not insignificant sum in costs to the applicant. 10. I am satisfied that this is not a case where the nature of the proposed penalty is an insufficient deterrent by community standards so as to cause the Court to decline to sanction the proposal. I note the submissions by Mr Atkinson that the suspension of the six month sentence results in the third and fourth respondents being their own ""judge and jury"" for 24 months and that this is well-calculated to ensure their good behaviour. While this remains to be seen in practice, the detailed and clear nature of the proposed orders, the permanent restraints on the conduct of the respondents as articulated in the proposal, the not inconsiderable length of time during which the sentence is suspended and the default period of imprisonment in the event of breach of the orders in my view means that the proposed penalty appropriate in this case."

GROUNDS OF APPEAL (i) Disqualification issue The appellants claim that Phipps FM should have disqualified himself from hearing the application because he had heard a similar matter previously. They also allege that the proceeding was part-heard before another Federal Magistrate. (ii) Substantive issue The appellants further allege that his Honour's judgment was made on ""grounds that are not a factor for consideration"" in the proper exercise of his discretion. (ii) Other grounds The appellants contend that Phipps FM failed to give them time ""to read two submitted precedents"" which were referred to in the reasons for judgment.

Case23959,cited,"SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 , 170 FCR 515","provision, it has repeatedly been acknowledged, "" suffers from a lack of clarity "": SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 , 170 FCR 515. Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ there usefully summarised as follows some of the less contentious matters involved in the construction of that provision: [10] In a series of cases decided under s 91R(3) , it has been common ground that the subsection suffers from a lack of clarity. Before turning to the difficulties to which the drafting gives rise, it will be convenient to mention some uncontentious matters relating to the construction of the subsection. First, the subsection is cast in imperative terms: it obliges a decision maker to disregard conduct in Australia by an applicant for a protection visa subject to the proviso in paragraph (b). Secondly, the stipulation that a decision maker must ""disregard"" an applicant's conduct in Australia requires that such conduct not be brought into consideration when determining whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for a Convention reason. Thirdly, although the Explanatory Memorandum and the second reading speech both indicate that s 91R(3) of the Act was introduced to deal with sur place claims, it is not, in terms, so confined. Conduct in Australia which is undertaken in order to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in the applicant's country of origin, would support a sur place claim. Other types of conduct may not. Section 91R(3) obliges decision makers to disregard ""any"" conduct by the applicant in Australia. That requirement is qualified by paragraph (b) which provides scope for an applicant to satisfy the decision maker that he or she has engaged in the relevant conduct ""otherwise than for the purpose of strengthening the person's claims to be a refugee ..."". Conduct in Australia which attracts adverse attention from a foreign government for Convention related reasons would strengthen a person's claim to be a refugee. So too, however, would conduct in Australia which, in an evidentiary sense, rendered it more likely that an applicant had engaged in conduct in his or her home country which led to persecution in that country. Both types of conduct may be engaged in in Australia. ... Decisions of this Court were the catalyst for the introduction of s 91R(3). Those decisions held that a person could become a refugee as a result of conduct, deliberately pursued in Australia, to attract the adverse attention of the authorities in his or her country of origin: [2008] FCAFC 105 at [24] . Special leave to appeal, it should be noted, has been granted: Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJGV; Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZJXO [2008] HCATrans 404. It is unnecessary to resolve a third contention advanced by the Minister. This contention was that s 91R(3) is not engaged where an applicant does not seek to rely on conduct in Australia to support a well-founded fear of persecution (cf SZHFE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2006] FCA 648 at [30] per Jacobson J; SZLQX v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCA 1286 at [21] per Jacobson J) or where evidence of conduct is adduced or called by an applicant ( SZJGV v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 105 at [16] and [21] to [23] per Spender, Edmonds and Tracey JJ). The contention was that the present Appellant did not seek to rely upon the 1999 or 2000 conduct and did not adduce evidence of such conduct."
Case4762,applied,Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK [2009] FCAFC 83,"there is no requirement imposed upon the Tribunal to afford a party any opportunity to comment upon proposed findings that it may make: WAGU v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 912 per French J, as His Honour then was, at [36]. There is no such obligation imposed by the common law: Scorgie v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 2046 , 47 AAR 314 , applying F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Company AG v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry [1975] AC 295 at 369 per Diplock LJ. Nor does "" information "" for the purposes of s 424A "" encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations "": SZEEU , supra , at [206]. In SZBYR , supra , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed (citations omitted): [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting ""information"" within the meaning of par (a) of s 424A(1). Again, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute ""information"". Finn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs that the word ""information"": does not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc. If the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process. However broadly ""information"" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence. The appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant ""information"" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself. See also Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMOK [2009] FCAFC 83 at [16] per Emmett, Kenny and Jacobson JJ; SZIWL v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007] FCA 1260 at [20] to [21] per Siopis J."

The thought processes of the Tribunal may reveal the relevance of information for s 424A(1)(b) and may assist in understanding what the Tribunal must say or do to comply with s 424A(1)(a), (b) or (c).""

Case16206,considered,Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; [1961] 108 CLR 642,"I note that even if I had considered that the probative value of Mr Frick's expert report was not outweighed by the prejudice to the applicants within the meaning of s 135 , I would have ruled that it be given no weight. The weight to be accorded to an expert opinion depends to a significant degree upon the factual basis for such an opinion (cf for example Ramsay v Watson [1961] HCA 65 ; [1961] 108 CLR 642 at 649, Branson J in Quick 87 FCR 371 at 621, Notaras v Hugh [2003] NSWSC 167 at [20] ). I have already discussed in detail the difficulties associated with the lack of identification of sources, and what appears to be the intertwining of information from those sources with the specialised knowledge of Mr Frick in producing his report. Given the facts that: &#8226; a significant factual basis of Mr Frick's opinions was unidentified persons contacted specifically for the purpose of obtaining information upon which to base his opinions, which sources cannot be tested in any way; and &#8226; importantly, the extent to which Mr Frick's opinions were based on these sources compared with his own specialised knowledge (or, in relation to yield, the DPI publication) was unclear from his report the inevitable result in my view was that the report could be accorded no weight even if admitted."
Case15911,followed,NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287,"These grounds cannot succeed. The facts of this case are quite close to the facts of three unanimous decisions of Full Courts of this Court. The members of each court were different. The decisions are NAST v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 208 (Beaumont, Merkel and Hely JJ), NAVX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 287 (French, Emmett and Dowsett JJ) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v VSAF of 2003 [2005] FCAFC 73 (Black CJ, Sundberg and Bennett JJ). In each case the court emphasised the proposition that the task of the Minister, through his delegate, and the Refugee Review Tribunal on appeal, pursuant to s 65 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), is to consider whether they are satisfied that the requirements for the grant of a visa have been satisfied. It will be difficult to achieve the requisite degree of satisfaction if the appellant does not provide sufficient information, such as by not attending a hearing. In the absence of a positive finding of satisfaction, a visa application must be rejected. In NAVX at paragraph [5] the Full Court said this: ""In assessing the adequacy of [the Tribunal's] reasons, it must be kept in mind that the Tribunal had indicated to the appellant that it was unable to find in his favour on the basis of the material in its possession and invited him to attend to provide additional information. Clearly enough, the Tribunal was not obliged to accept at face value his short and very vague outline of his basis for fearing persecution in China. Having found that the outline was not sufficient to satisfy it that the appellant had a well-founded fear of persecution, it could do little more than offer him an opportunity to elaborate. When he failed to accept that opportunity, the inevitable consequence was the rejection of his application."""
Case17392,followed,Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259,"The Grounds of Appeal , it is considered, are but an impermissible attempt to review the factual merits of the decision reached by the Tribunal and should be rejected. A court conducting judicial review of an administrative decision must "" beware of turning a review of the reasons of the decision-maker upon proper principles into a reconsideration of the merits of the decision "": Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ. The "" weight "" to be given to the evidence or particular pieces of information is for the Tribunal to assess: Abebe v Commonwealth [1999] HCA 14 at [197] , [2004] HCA 32 ; 197 CLR 510 at 580. Justice Kirby there observed, in the context of those proceedings: [197] It may be accepted that, as the applicant submitted, much of the Tribunal's statement of reasons focuses upon what the applicant said about her husband's arrest and whether what she had said on that subject was to be believed. But it did this in the context of assessing whether her claims that she had been persecuted in the past should be accepted. The Tribunal's reasoning does not reveal any failure to take account of relevant matters or any taking into account of irrelevant matters. In the end, the criticisms made by the applicant of the Tribunal's reasoning are criticisms of the factual findings it made and are criticisms that fasten upon the weight that the Tribunal attributed to various pieces of information that it had available for consideration. But what weight the Tribunal gave to those various pieces of information was for it to say. The task of making findings of fact, including findings as to credibility, is for the Tribunal alone: Kopalapillai v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1126 ; (1998) 86 FCR 547 at 552, 559."

Case2411,applied,Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365,"nature of an ""appeal"" to the Federal Court under s 35 (and in respect of a decision in an opposition proceeding under s 56) has been discussed at length in several cases: see Blount 83 FCR at 58D-59A (Branson J); Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 at [21] - [22] (French J); Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 ( Woolworths ) at [32]-[34] (French J). In hearing an appeal pursuant to s 35, the Court exercises its original jurisdiction and conducts a hearing de novo. It is to determine on the merits the same question that was before the Registrar namely, whether or not the trade mark should be accepted and in doing so, it is to apply the same legal criteria that the Registrar is required to adopt under the Act. The Registrar's decision is not to be presumed correct but the Court is entitled to have regard to the Registrar's opinion as that of a skilled and experienced person in the field of trade mark registrations: Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [33] (French J). Presumption of registrability and standard of proof Dealing firstly with the issue of onus, it is now well understood that s 33 of the Act had the effect of reversing the previous position on onus under the 1955 Act. Whereas under that Act an applicant had to satisfy the Registrar that there were no grounds to object to registration, the position now is that an application must be registered, unless the Registrar is satisfied that there is a ground for rejecting it: see s 33 and reg 17A.24; see also the discussion by French J in Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [15] and [20]-[24]. An applicant is thus said to have the benefit of a ""presumption of registrability"" under the Act. In other words, a mark will be presumed registrable unless the Registrar is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that a ground to reject it exists. In Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 , the Full Court considered an application for registration of a shape mark where the only ground of possible rejection was s 41(2). The applicant adduced no evidence of use of the mark and did not rely on either s 41(5) or (6). As a result the case turned on the sole question whether the mark was inherently adapted to distinguish the applicant's goods under s 41(3). In discussing the nature of appeals against decisions of the Registrar, French J stated at [22]: Since the enactment of the 1995 Act the onus is no longer on the applicant to establish registrability as it was under the 1955 Act: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths Ltd [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; (1999) 93 FCR 365 at 372 3 ... The application must be accepted unless the court is satisfied that it has not been made in accordance with the Act or that there are grounds for rejecting it. If the matter is in doubt then the application should be accepted. The possibility of refusal after a contested opposition with evidence and closer scrutiny remains open. The acceptance stage is not the time for detailed adversarial examination of the application that might be involved in an opposition: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths at FCR 377 .... Acceptance for registration involves an initial screening process albeit it requires the application of statutory criteria and evaluative judgments by the Registrar and the Registrar's delegates. (Emphasis added.) Later, in addressing whether the mark was inherently adapted to distinguish, his Honour said at [50]: [I]t is necessary to bear in mind that this trade mark is still at the registration stage. It enjoys the benefit of the presumption of registrability mandated by s 33. To the extent that critical criteria upon which registration might be rejected are in doubt, the application should be accepted. Closer adversarial scrutiny may occur in opposition: Registrar of Trade Marks v Woolworths at FCR 377 .... There is a tension between the operation of the presumption and the text and structure of s 41. Section 41(3) requires the Registrar to ""take into account"" the extent to which a mark is inherently adapted to distinguish in deciding whether or not it is ""capable of distinguishing"" the applicant's goods. Section 41(4) then directs the decision-maker to subs 41(5) and subs 41(6), if they are ""still unable to decide the question"". Section 41(5) will be applicable if there is a finding that the mark is to some extent inherently adapted, but the Registrar is ""unable to decide, on that basis alone, that the mark is capable of ... distinguishing"". Accordingly, where there remains some doubt after considering s 41(3) about a mark's capability to distinguish, rather than resolving that doubt in favour of an applicant (by operation of a presumption), the statute expressly directs the decision-maker to consider the criteria in subs 41(5) or subs 41(6) (whichever is applicable). These observations have been followed in several first instance decisions, albeit with varying degrees of caution: see Bennett J in Torpedoes Sportswear Pty Ltd v Thorpedo Enterprises Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 901 ; (2003) 59 IPR 318 ( Torpedoes ) at [16]-[22], Finn J in Austereo [2004] FCA 968 ; 61 IPR 257 at [4] - [5] and Lander J in Kowa Company Ltd v NV Organon [2005] FCA 1282 ; (2005) 66 IPR 131 at [123] - [141] . In Austereo , Finn J considered that he ought ""as a matter of comity"" apply the Lomas standard as adopted by Bennett J in Torpedoes . In Kowa , Lander J expressed some doubt about the point but considered he was bound by Lomas and the Full Court decision in Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365. Guylian did not seek to justify in a substantive way the approach of the Full Court in Lomas . It sought to rely on the decision, and those that have followed it, but it acknowledged that other decisions run counter to it. In my view, there is nothing in the relevant provisions that supports the imposition of a higher standard, even at the acceptance stage. The ""presumption of registrability"" arises from s 33 of the Act: Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 at [24] ; Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 at [50] . Section 33 does not speak of being ""clearly satisfied""; it mandates acceptance of an application unless the Registrar "" is satisfied that ... there are grounds for rejecting it"". On this point, I prefer the views expressed by Gyles J and in particular his Honour's observations that an acceptance that there is a presumption of registrability ""says nothing as to the standard of proof"" and does not import a higher threshold than the conventional balance of probabilities: see Pfizer [2006] FCA 1663 ; (2006) 70 IPR 599 at [18] . The presumption as it is gives effect to the general position under the Act that an applicant is not required to establish an absence of grounds to refuse or object to registration. It should also be noted that in both Woolworths [1999] FCAFC 1020 ; 93 FCR 365 and Kenman Kandy [2002] FCAFC 273 ; 122 FCR 494 (both acceptance stage cases) there is no suggestion that any special higher standard was applicable."
Case5896,considered,"Sinclair, Scott &amp; Co Ltd v Naughton [1929] HCA 34 ; (1929) 43 CLR 310 at 327","Finally, the Commissioner's reference to and reliance upon the parties' prior and subsequent conduct is misplaced.

I, too, accept this proposition. Its correctness seems to me to follow inexorably from the standing granted to ASIC in the circumstances described in s 462(2)(e) and s 464(1). There will be occasions and this is one where, in the course of an investigation, matters come to the attention of ASIC that motivate it to seek the winding up of a company on the just and equitable ground because it is in the public interest and perhaps also on other grounds, notably, insolvency. As noted, the latter requires a grant of leave to ASIC but the conditions for that are met. I grant leave."

Case21648,cited,Clark Equipment Co v Registrar of Trade Marks [1964] HCA 55 ; (1964) 111 CLR 511,"The next ground of attack against the registration of the trade mark is that it was not distinctive of Colorado Group's goods.

Generally, a word, name or device (or any other designation that may be a ""sign"" for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act ) can only be distinctive of a person's goods or services if it is ""inherently adapted to distinguish"" those goods or services or, if it is not inherently distinctive, if it has become distinctive by use, that is if it has acquired a secondary meaning. A designation that is merely descriptive of the character of the goods or of their geographic origin or location cannot be inherently distinctive.

Case8138,cited,Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co 192 Cal Reptr 732 (1983),"way of preface I should note that up until final written submissions the case had been prosecuted by Hamilton on the basis that AMC, as Hamilton's fiduciary, held the two trademarks as constructive trustee for it, the marks having been obtained by it in breach of its fiduciary duty to Hamilton. The constructive trust claim and with it, seemingly, the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty were abandoned in Hamilton's written submissions. I say ""seemingly"" in relation to the fiduciary claim because it was scarcely addressed in submissions yet it is anything but non-contentious in the propositions it asserts: see Hospital Products Ltd ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co 192 Cal Reptr 732 (1983); Glover, Commercial Equity: Fiduciary Relationships , 3.48-3.51 (1995); and for the causes of contention in this area of the law see my ""Fiduciary Principle"" in Youdan (ed), Equity, Fiduciaries and Trusts , 1 (1989); see also Gibson Motorsport Merchandise Pty Ltd v Forbes [2006] FCAFC 44 ; (2006) 149 FCR 569 at [11] - [16] . I will return to this in the context of AMC's copyright ownership claim. It was open to Hamilton and AMC to cast their contractual relationship in a way which could, for certain purposes at least, have obliged AMC to act in Hamilton's interests alone or, distinctly, in their joint interests: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [7]-[16]. They chose to formalise their relationship as one of supplier and distributor, a type of relationship which characteristically is designed, subject to contractual limitations, to serve the several interests of the participants: see Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation ; Rickel v Schwinn Bicycle Co . The Distribution Agreement, and the parties conduct under in it in relation to the packaging was quite characteristic of this. Dr Keung was permitted to serve AMC's interests in selling products it acquired from Hamilton, by utilising artwork and language which he considered would facilitate the sale of those products in the area of the Agreement, so furthering AMC's own interests. Hamilton, in turn, would thereby have its own interests served to the extent that enhanced sales by AMC would be likely to lead to enhanced orders from Hamilton. While AMC was given latitude in the language so used, Hamilton in turn was able to protect its own interests in this matter. It retained for itself a right to approve all statements made on the packaging because of its exposure to product liability and it insisted that the two language versions had to match (to comply with requirements of the TGA scheme). There was nothing fiduciary in this arrangement though it doubtless required elements of trust, cooperation and reliance by the parties if it was to work effectively. But these element of themselves did not turn a non-fiduciary contractual relationship into a fiduciary and personal one outside of, and potentially inconsistent with, the contract itself: cf Gibson Motorsport Merchandise at [11]."
Case7288,referred to,Allen v Townsend [1977] FCA 10 ; (1977) 31 FLR 431,"those orders be continued against other respondents who are members of the NUW? The answer to this question depends on whether, as members, they are bound to perform and observe the Rules by engaging or not engaging in the conduct which is the subject of his Honour's orders. As officers, they were subject to the rules because they owed fiduciary obligations to the union: cf Allen v Townsend [1977] FCA 10 ; (1977) 31 FLR 431 at 483. Members, as such, do not have equivalent fiduciary obligations. Mr Borenstein nonetheless argued that members of an organisation are under an obligation not to act against the interests of the organisation of which they are members. He submitted that the Rules constituted a compact which defined the relationship between the member and the union. There was, he submitted, an implied restraint against a member acting against the interests of the union by procuring resignations by other members. He referred to Rule 3 of the NUW rules, which provides that, where a member acts in a way that conflicts with the objects of the union, that member may be subject to a charge under Rule 67 for failing to observe the rules of the union. The only object to which he referred was that found in rule 2(44) which was 'To enrol into membership of the union all employees eligible to become members of the union'."
Case9230,referred to,Russell v Scott [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440,"The presumption of a resulting trust that arises when property is transferred without consideration into the name of a person who is neither the child, adopted child or wife of the transferor, does no more than call for proof of an intention to confer beneficial ownership. Prima facie there is a resulting trust but where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership, the presumption is rebutted (see Russell v Scott ('Russell v Scott') [1936] HCA 34 ; (1936) 55 CLR 440 the case of an aunt who put money into a joint bank account in her name and that of her nephew on the basis that it would be held in trust for the aunt during her lifetime but thereafter the beneficial interest would pass to the nephew). 131 Given Mr Ku's evidence that he prepared the 'Change to company details' form, a copy of which is reproduced in Schedule 1, before his meeting with Luke Song on 25 October, that it bears the date 23 October and was handed by Mr Ku to Mr Kim on 24 October with the request that Mr Kim forward it to ASIC in the express post envelope which Mr Ku provided, I have great difficulty in accepting that, when he was speaking with Luke Song on 25 October 2006, he said: 'I will transfer all my shares of Kjun International Pty Ltd to your son first as good gesture if you sign this agreement.' It is unlikely that he would have used the words mentioned and in particular the word 'if' in circumstances where the 'Change to company details' form had already been prepared, signed and handed to his solicitor Mr Kim for transmission to ASIC in Melbourne. I would place greater emphasis upon the words 'Everyone will say I am the most stupid person doing this but I value more our trust than who is got what and who has the right'. Equally, I have difficulty in accepting that the conversation included the words 'If anything goes wrong I didn't get a single dollar so I can get the shares back'. This is not a case where a resulting trust should be implied if it be found that the shares were duly transferred by Mr Ku to Ji Song. As was said in Russell v Scott there will be no resulting trust where satisfactory proof is forthcoming that a purpose of the transaction was to confer beneficial ownership. In my opinion such a transfer was intended in respect of the shares but not perfected, there being no duly executed share transfer form which was delivered to Ji Song or another person on his behalf. 132 Mr Ku says that, at the meeting on 25 October, he and Luke Song addressed the longer form of agreement which he had prepared on 24 October 2006. He said in relation to the consideration of the longer form of agreement: 'We ran through all the clauses in the agreement one by one.' 133 Luke Song deposed to the production by Mr Ku of a document with clauses 'A' to 'G' on it. This is hardly illuminating. There was no form of agreement which included clauses A, B, C, D, E, F and G. There were, however, two different forms of agreement which began with 'A' and ended with 'G'. The longer form of agreement included clauses A, B, C, D, D (a second D), F and G. The shorter form of agreement contained clauses A, B, D, F and G."

Case2764,cited,Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Co v Hy-Line Chicks Pty Ltd [1979] RPC 410,"in Pioneer Hi-Bred Corn Co v Hy-Line Chicks Pty Ltd [1979] RPC 410 at 424 Richardson J in the New Zealand Court of Appeal said, in considering a provision similar to s 60, that: for myself I prefer to use a more neutral term such as ""awareness"" or ""cognisance"" or ""knowledge"" and on that basis to ask: having regard to the awareness of the opponent's mark in the New Zealand market for goods covered by the registration proposed, would the use of the applicant's mark be likely to deceive or cause confusion to persons in that market. Fourth, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006 (Cth) is helpful in interpreting the s 60. Paragraph 4.10 of the Explanatory Memorandum provides as follows: 4.10 TRADE MARK SIMILAR TO TRADE MARK THAT HAS ACQUIRED A REPUTATION IN AUSTRALIA Section 60(a) 1 . The intention of section 60 of the Act is to implement Australia's obligations to protect well known marks under the Paris Convention for the Protection of Intellectual Property and the 1994 World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The provisions have not been written so as to establish a new class of trade marks (""well-known"" marks) or to prescribe a particular threshold of how well-known a mark must be. Rather, the test has been written so that it can be applied to all marks. The test depends on the extent of the reputation in Australia that has been acquired by a sign. In light of that reputation, the question to be asked is whether the use of a subsequent trade mark would be likely to result in deception or confusion. Section 60 is a ground for opposition to a trade mark application for registration, which can also be used under section 88 as a basis for cancellation of a registration by the courts. 2. Under the current arrangements the provisions of section 60 require that the applied-for mark be substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the trade mark forming the basis of opposition before consideration of any deception or confusion, resulting from the reputation of the opponent's trade mark, can take place. Substantial identity and deceptive similarity are tests undertaken in examination of an application before the opposition process, and have very well established scope. 3. There have been a number of instances where a trade mark has an established reputation in Australia, and use of a subsequently applied-for trade mark would deceive or cause confusion, even though the subsequent trade mark is not substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to the original trade mark. However, because of the way paragraph 60(a) of the Act is written it is not possible to currently use this provision to prevent registration of a mark which fails the tests for substantial identity or deceptive similarity, but which nevertheless will cause confusion or deception in relation to a well-known mark. The tests for deception and confusion are all well established in judicial authority, and hinge on the question of whether or not a reasonable number of people may be caused to wonder if a trade connection exists between the marks. By removing the requirement for substantial identity or deceptive similarity from section 60, the ground for opposition under section 60 can be used to oppose the registration of a trade mark because of the possible deception or confusion arising solely from the reputation of a trade mark. 4. Under the amended provisions the consideration of oppositions would take into account the extent of the reputation of the opposing mark at the time the opposed mark was applied for, and the likelihood of deception and confusion occurring in the marketplace because of this. 4.10.1 Items 31 32 1. New paragraph 60(a) of the Act provides that a trade mark may be opposed where another trade mark has a reputation, and the registration of the opposed mark will cause confusion or deception in the market place, whether or not the reputation is built on a mark that is identical or deceptively similar to the opposed mark. In light of this material I consider that the following is clear."
Case16621,referred to,Carter v Hyde [1923] HCA 36 ; (1923) 33 CLR 115,"The starting point is the option itself. There is no doubt that an option to purchase gives the optionee an equitable interest in the property. In fact the respondents concede that it is a prior equitable interest and that the answer to the first question is yes. There are many authorities on the point. It is sufficient for me to refer to the following: London and South Western Railway Co v Gomm (1882) 20 Ch D 562 at 580-581 per Jessel MR; Carter v Hyde [1923] HCA 36 ; (1923) 33 CLR 115; Commissioner of Taxes (Qld) v Camphin [1937] HCA 30 ; (1937) 57 CLR 127 at 132-134 per Latham CJ. Although Gibbs J (as he then was) in Laybutt v Amoco Australia Pty Ltd (1974) 132 CLR 59 ("" Laybutt "") at 75-76 identified the fact that an option to purchase gave rise to an equitable interest as a strong reason for characterising such an option as a conditional contract, rather than as an irrevocable offer, that 'standing controversy' as Sir Owen Dixon referred to it in Braham v Walker [1961] HCA 7 ; (1961) 104 CLR 366 at 376 has not been resolved and it is not necessary for me to take one view or the other for the purposes of answering the separate questions. It is to be noted that Gibbs J in Laybutt favoured the view that an option to purchase was a conditional contract to sell land which created a contingent equitable interest in the land."
Case24454,applied,"Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 629 , (1987) ATPR 40-807","Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation (1987) 18 FCR 212 , a Full Court of this Court held that the Northern Territory and a statutory authority of the Territory were not bound by the Act. Nonetheless, the Court held that there was accrued jurisdiction in this Court in respect of the common law claims brought against them. The Court said (18 FCR at 219): It is true that in answering questions 1 and 2 in the negative, we have determined preliminary points of law in the claims under the Act brought against the second and third respondents; and that, in consequence, there will be no further trial of those issues. But it does not follow that the Court ever lacked jurisdiction to deal with such claims. Nor does it follow that the Court now loses its jurisdiction to deal with the attached common law claims: see Moorgate Tobacco Co Ltd v Philip Morris Ltd [1980] HCA 32 ; (1980) 145 CLR 457 at 469, 472, 477; Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Australia) Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-795 ; 75 ALR 271 , and Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) ATPR 40-807 ; 75 ALR 629. In principle, the position is no different than it would have been if the claims under the Act had proceeded to trial and had been dismissed on the merits. In that situation, it could not seriously be suggested that the dismissal of the claims under the Act had the effect of depriving the Court of jurisdiction to deal with any attached non-federal claim. The position may have been different if the claims under the Act had been ""colourable"" in the sense that they were made for the improper purpose of ""fabricating"" jurisdiction: see P H Lane, Lane's Commentary on the Australian Constitution (1986), pp 367-368 and the cases there cited. There is no room for such a suggestion here. The applicants' case that the second and third respondents were bound by the Act cannot be said to be unarguable; and we think it was pursued bona fide: cf R v Cook; Ex parte Twigg [1980] HCA 36 ; (1980) 147 CLR 15 per Gibbs J at 26. Those statements were entirely in line with observations to the same effect made in Dorotea Pty Ltd v Vancleve Pty Ltd (1987) 75 ALR 629 at 632 and in Elna Australia Pty Ltd v International Computers (Aust) Pty Ltd (No 2) [1987] FCA 230 ; (1987) 16 FCR 410 at 415 416 (per Gummow J)."
Case22152,cited,WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Mayo-Ramsay) v Maitland City Council (1998) 83 IR 362,"this case the respondent admits that the result of its conduct was the death of Mr McCallum. While there is no question here that Mr McCallum's death was actually foreseen by the respondent, in my view implementing a work method incorporating an appropriate radio protocol would not have been unreasonable, and to so find now is not, in my view, ""substituting reasonable hindsight for reasonable foresight"" ( WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Mayo-Ramsay) v Maitland City Council (1998) 83 IR 362 at 381). The size of the plant involved, the vulnerability of workers in front of it, and the very real risk of serious injury or death in the absence of a fail-safe means of immediate emergency communication does suggest a systemic failure by the respondent rather than ""a risk to which an employee was exposed because of a combination of inadvertence on the part of an employee and a momentary lapse of supervision"" as contended by the respondent. Indeed, it is not conclusive that there was either inadvertence on the part of Mr McCallum or a momentary lapse in his supervision by Mr Grech and the incident still occurred. It is clear that, despite the efforts taken by the respondent to implement a safe working environment, the operation involving the transportation unit was flawed in its original conception. The dangers were obvious from the start, relatively simple to avoid, but unrecognised and unaddressed in a manner which raises the objective gravity of the offence in these proceedings towards the higher end of the scale. The respondent submits that the improvements made to its work systems and the immediate action it took following the incident indicate that specific deterrence is not a factor of significance in this matter. I disagree. While the initiatives of the respondent are to be applauded, a relevant consideration in respect of the quantum of a penalty is that it be a deterrence to the specific employer in question as well as the community at large (including other employers). The respondent in this case has admitted that the result of its conduct was the death of an employee. It is necessary that the penalty reflect that fact. Further, while the work systems in place at the time of the incident support a finding that the respondent had adopted an approach to safety which was proactive rather than reactive, it is clear from both the obviousness of the risk to which Mr McCallum was fatally exposed and the simple but effective measures put in place since the incident including the adoption of a radio protocol that there were serious deficiencies in the quality of the proactive work undertaken."
Case13275,cited,Re Turf Enterprises Pty Ltd [1975] Qd R 266,"I have already indicated that the plaintiff has not sought to rely upon any other basis for winding up Dromana than its failure to comply with the statutory demand. Shorn of the presumption of insolvency, that application has been so narrowly drawn as to be doomed to failure: see Ford's Principles of Corporations Law at [27.050]. While on a s 459P application the Court may order that an insolvent company be wound up in insolvency: see s 459A; there is no evidentiary basis before me that could suggest insolvency, other than the non-compliance itself. When viewed in the context of the affidavit evidence that has been filed in support of, and in opposition to, the present application, the position is no different. A serious dispute exists between the parties. But Dromana's insolvency is not suggested: cf Re Turf Enterprises Pty Ltd [1975] Qd R 266. Perhaps it was for this reason that counsel for Mr Gryst apparently accepted that the originating process as it stands could not succeed without the aid of the presumption. I am thus in the position of being satisfied in the circumstances that Mr Gryst has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting his s 459P application. 15 I will in consequence order under s 31A(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act that the originating process be dismissed. I have directed the parties to file and serve submissions relating to costs."
Case4330,followed,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd [2000] FCA 66 ; (2000) 96 FCR 389,"This approach is consistent with that expressed by Mansfield J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Rural Press Ltd [2000] FCA 66 ; (2000) 96 FCR 389 at [38] , [40]. 91 Accepting therefore that the exercise of the power is confined to the purpose stated by Deane J, the question then is whether it follows from the concessions made by Mr Pearson that the Notice was issued other than for the administrative function of determining whether proceedings should be instituted. 92 It is true that Mr Pearson accepted that the information sought by the Notice does not go to establishing any element of a breach of the provisions of s 45(2)(a) or (b) of the Act. But, in my opinion, it does not follow that the decision to issue and serve the Notice was for an improper purpose. There are two reasons for this. 102 Fourth, in Rural Press at [37], Mansfield J agreed with the view expressed by Lockhart J in Kotan . Mansfield J went on at [38] to say that the question of whether the power has been exercised for an improper purpose is a matter to be decided in all the circumstances. I respectfully agree with this observation. 119 The short answer to KAL's submission is that the evidence before me demonstrates that the purpose of the ACCC in deciding to issue the Notice was to obtain evidence of the extent of any contraventions by KAL and evidence going to the quantum of any penalty. All of this might ultimately be used in the event that the ACCC decides to commence proceedings. This purpose falls ""squarely within the Act"": Rural Press at [40]. 120 Reference was made in cross-examination of Mr Pearson to the ACCC's knowledge of difficulties encountered in obtaining an order for discovery and interrogatories in existing proceedings. It has not been demonstrated that this was an actuating purpose in the decision to serve the Notice. 121 The application will be dismissed. I will hear the parties briefly on the question of costs.

Case6930,applied,SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 ; (2009) 174 FCR 415,"am not satisfied that the Tribunal applied the wrong test in assessing reasonableness. The test for relocation is whether it is reasonable in the sense of being practicable in the particular circumstances of the particular applicant ( SZATV at [24]). The answer to that question, in turn, depends upon the framework set by the particular objections raised to relocation (see SZMCD v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 46 ; (2009) 174 FCR 415 at [124] per Tracey and Foster JJ)."
Case10978,cited,Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46,"Early in the history of these provisions it was established that they could not be used to restrict genuine business decisions by an employer, notwithstanding that the objective of the provisions then was the protection of unions and collective action ( Connington v Municipality of Kogarah [1913] AR (NSW) 40 at 44; Grayndler v Broun [1928] AR (NSW) 46 at 49; Klanjscek v Silver (1961) 4 FLR 182 at 187; Moss v Fantil Pty Ltd t/as Central Coast Security Services (1994) 58 IR 118 at 127). The underlying principle is that a decision that may affect an employee or a class of employee does not discriminate against or victimise that employee or those employees if it is taken for a sound business reason. This principle has been applied in various situations in more recent times in considering a prohibited reason within the meaning of s 793 and similar provisions. Examples include Qenos Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 178 ; 108 FCR 90 at [119] [126]; Australian Collieries' Staff Association v BHP Coal Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 318 ; (2000) 99 FCR 137 , particularly at [66] [67]; CSL Australia Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 513 , 113 IR 326, particularly at [55] [60]; BHP Iron Ore Pty Ltd v Australian Workers' Union [2000] FCA 430 ; 102 FCR 97 at [48] ; and Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 , particularly at [294] [302]."
Case8816,applied,Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 ,"This area of the law is controversial. Choses in action in general are assignable (eg s 12 Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW)). However, a bare right to litigate requires special consideration. Although maintenance was referred to in this context, no submissions were directed to the effect of the Maintenance, Champerty and Barratry Abolition Act 1993 (NSW) (cf Campbell J in Mid-City Skin Cancer and Laser Centre Pty Ltd v Zahedi-Anarak (2006) 67 NSWLR 569 at [194]). It is convenient to discuss the cause of action in negligence first. In 1953 the High Court, in Poulton v Commonwealth (1953) 89 CLR 540 at 602, in relation to a claim in conversion, baldly said: ""... according to well-established principle, the right was incapable of assignment either at law or in equity"". Lord Roskill said in Trendtex Trading Corporation v Credit Suisse [1982] AC 679 at 702C: ""Though in general choses in action were assignable, yet causes of action which were essentially personal in their character, such as claims for defamation or personal injury, were incapable of assignment..."" 30 One well established category where an assignment is valid (recognised by the authorities cited in Poulton 89 CLR 540 at 602) is an assignment of property, even though the property may be incapable of being recovered without litigation or, as it was put by Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 at 703, where the cause of action is incidental to a right of property that has been acquired. There is no reason why such a cause of action could not include tort in an appropriate case eg detinue or conversion. However, based upon the submissions in this case, examples of the practical application of the principle are sparse. Re Daley; Ex parte National Australia Bank Ltd (1992) 37 FCR 390 was cited but the decision turned on what was held to be the assignment of a debt (37 FCR at 394 395). In Monk v Australian and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1994) 34 NSWLR 148 there had been no assignment of the cheques that would have constituted the necessary property. In that case, Cohen J referred to the decision of Gault J in First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1989] 3 NZLR 710 where it was held (at 757) that the assignment of a debenture by a parent company to a subsidiary included an assignment of causes of action in tort against a receiver of the company that issued the debenture and that the causes of action in tort were ancillary to the assignment of the debenture and so valid. The effect of that decision is somewhat clouded by the subsequent appellate history of the case ( First City Corporation Ltd v Downsview Nominees Ltd [1990] 3 NZLR 265; Downsview Nominees Ltd v First City Corporation Ltd [1993] AC 295) although the appeals did not turn upon the point in issue here. 31 The decision of Finkelstein J in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd v 3Fold Resources Pty Ltd (No 3) (2007) 158 FCR 444 may be seen as an example of the category of connection with property. There, the assignment of a cause of action for breach of confidential information, connected with or relating to rights of property that were assigned, was upheld (see particularly 158 FCR 444 at [79] [81]). However, that decision, and others since 1982, have been influenced by dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 indicating another basis for exception from the general rule whether the assignee has a ""genuine and substantial interest in the success of the ... litigation"" (per Lord Wilberforce at 694D) or has a ""genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of the claim of another"" (per Lord Roskill at 703D). 33 Finkelstein J took the wider view in TS &amp; B Retail Systems Pty Ltd 158 FCR 444 and suggested that the High Court in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd v Fostif Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; (2006) 229 CLR 386 had approved the effect of the statements by Lords Wilberforce and Roskill in Trendtex [1982] AC 679. The precise point that arises here did not arise in Campbell's Cash and Carry Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 41 ; 229 CLR 386. However, the reasoning of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ at [68] [82] and Callinan and Heydon JJ at [258] [261] supports the opinion of Finkelstein J. In my opinion, the principle enunciated in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 can be taken to be established for Australia. It needs to be borne in mind that the statement in Poulton 89 CLR 540 was not the centre of controversy in that case. 34 Did All Saints have a genuine commercial interest in the enforcement of Tosich's claim? There is no direct evidence concerning the position of All Saints prior to the transaction. The inescapable inference from all the circumstances, including the structure of the transaction, is that All Saints was under the control of the Warne interests and that the transaction was to ensure that this proceeding continued notwithstanding a reluctance to pursue it on the part of Tosich. In particular, it seems to be aimed at removing or minimising Tosich's risk as to costs. It may be inferred that the purpose was to provide a vehicle for the defendants to pursue their cross-claims with the benefit of a claim proved by a plaintiff. That would remove the kind of problem exemplified by CGU Insurance Ltd v AMP Financial Planning Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 36 ; (2007) 237 ALR 420 ; (2007) 81 ALJR 1551 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 609. Indeed, as much was made clear by counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendants on various occasions. I do not see anything objectionable about that purpose or about the structure of the transaction. All Saints could not profit from the arrangement. It is not ""trafficking"" in causes of actions in any real sense. Facilitation of cross-claims to be determined on their merits is not objectionable as such. However, it seems to me that the dicta in Trendtex [1982] AC 679 would have to be extended to include these circumstances within the permissible categories of assignment. The assignee is not shown to have had any interest in the claim prior to, or regardless of, the assignment. In view of the controversy surrounding the topic, an extension of the categories is not the province of a single judge. 35 What, then, of the connection with property? Austin J found that there were property interests created by the scheme. The deed purports to assign those interests and causes of action, including the present. In one sense, there is a clear connection. The intention is to recover the loss of property invested. However, the claim in negligence is not to recover the property that existed at the time of the transaction it is to recover the loss by way of damages. In my opinion, that is not the kind of claim connected with property that is covered by the traditional exception to the rule against assignment of causes of action, assuming, as I do, that the exception can include claims in tort where appropriate. The assignment of the cause of action in tort is not effective. 36 In the course of argument, counsel for the plaintiffs referred to a claim for money had and received. The Third Amended Originating Process claims, inter alia: ""Orders in the nature of restitutionary orders for the refund to the Plaintiffs of the moneys originally invested in the Queen Victoria Project by the First Plaintiff and interest."" The Third Amended Statement of Claim does not include pleading to support that claim and no amendment has been sought. Such a claim can be ignored for present purposes."

In Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187 at 195, 70 ALR 185 at 193, Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ helpfully observed in respect to this provision: What is needed to justify an extension of time is indicated in r 15(2) by the words ""for special reasons"". It is that there be shown a special reason why the appeal should be permitted to proceed, though filed after the expiry of twenty-one days. In that context, the expression ""special reasons"" is intended to distinguish the case from the usual course according to which the time is twenty-one days. But it may be so distinguished (not necessarily will, for the rule gives a discretion) wherever the Court sees a ground which does justify departure from the general rule in the particular case. Such a ground is a special reason because it takes the case out of the ordinary. We do not think the use of the expression ""for special reasons"" implies something narrower than this. ... It should not be overlooked that r 15(2) enables leave to be given ""at any time""; the ""special reasons"" relevant to such a power cannot but describe an elastic test, suitable for application across a range of situations, from an oversight of a day to a neglect persisted in during a prolonged period. It would require something very persuasive indeed to justify a grant of leave after, for example, a year; equally, it may be said, something much less significant might justify leave where a party is a few days late. ""Special reasons"" must be understood in a sense capable of accommodating both types of situation. It is an expression describing a flexible discretionary power, but one requiring a case to be made upon grounds sufficient to justify a departure, in the particular circumstances, from the ordinary rule prescribing a period within which an appeal must be filed and served.

Case3073,cited,Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383,"contraventions on 15, 17 and 21 February 2006 had the same purpose, namely, to coerce Hardcorp to re-employ Messrs Deans and O'Donnell and Ms Singleton at the Mount Street site and, amongst other things, to have Ms Singleton appointed as OH&amp;S officer on the Mount Street site. This was the common thread running through the offending conduct of 15, 17 and 21 February 2006. To this extent, the comparison with Hamberger v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2002] FCA 585 is justified. Further, the fact of this common thread should be taken into account in fixing penalties, but, in my view, the contravening conduct is not, for this reason, properly seen as one course of conduct. This is because the conduct comprising each of the contraventions was separate and distinct in time and place, and in the coercion that the Union exerted. The conduct on 15 February 2006 involved demands and threats to cause trouble at the Mount Street site if the demands were not met. The conduct on 17 February 2006 involved similar demands and threats but on a different day and place, and in a different context with different participants in the occasion of the contravention. The conduct on 21 February 2006 involved Mr Mates coming on to the site and shutting down the crane. Therefore, these are three separate and distinct contraventions: compare Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 at 396-399 [41] - [55] ; [2008] FCAFC 70 at [41] - [55] per Stone and Buchanan JJ. As noted above, where (as here) penalties are being imposed for a number of related contraventions, it is necessary to ensure that the penalties in aggregate are just and appropriate to the circumstances of the case. As Tracey J said in Stuart-Mohoney 177 IR at 73 [60]: Another factor to be considered is the totality principle. This principle is designed to ensure that the aggregate of penalties imputed is not such as to be oppressive or crushing see: Kelly v Fitzpatrick [2007] FCA 1080 ; (2007) 166 IR 14 at [30] referred to with approval by Buchanan J in Australian Opthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 at [89] . The orthodox position requires the determination of appropriate penalties for each contravention arising from the same course of conduct. The aggregate figure is then considered to ensure that the penalty is an appropriate response to the conduct in question see: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (1997) 75 FCR 238 ; 145 ALR 36 at 53 and Ponzio at [145] per Jessup J. Penalties must also be proportionate to the culpability and seriousness of the respondent's contravening conduct and sufficient to mark the seriousness of that conduct. Neither respondent has expressed any contrition."

The applicants submit that publication by Veda was not made on an occasion of qualified privilege. They rely on Macintosh v Dun [1908] UKPCHCA 3 ; (1908) 6 CLR 303 ; [1908] AC 390. Veda submits that Macintosh v Dun was wrongly decided and should not be followed. I turn now to Macintosh v Dun [1908] UKPCHCA 3 ; (1908) 6 CLR 303 ; [1908] AC 390. On appeal, the Privy Council ([1908] AC 390 at 400) referred to the facts that: Their Lordships identified ""the real question"" as being whether it was ""in the interests of the community"" and ""for the welfare of society"" that the protection that the law gave to communications made in legitimate self-defence or from a bona fide sense of duty ""should be extended to communications made from motives of self-interest by persons who trade for profit in the characters of other people"" (at 400). Answering this question ""no"", they added: But information such as that which [the defendants] offer for sale may be obtained in many ways, not all of them deserving of commendation. It may be extorted from the person whose character is in question through fear of misrepresentation or misconstruction if he remains silent. It may be gathered from gossip. It may be picked up from discharged servants. It may be betrayed by disloyal employees. It is only right that those who engage in such a business, touching so closely very dangerous ground, should take the consequences if they overstep the law."
Case16157,cited,Centurion Roller Shutters Pty Ltd v Automatic Technology (Australia) Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1118,"While Mr Perry's submission that the expert opinion of Mr Frick did not comply with the relevant Practice Direction was technically correct, in the circumstances before me I make the following observations: a. It is clear from Mr Frick's affidavit, p 1 of his expert report (MBF-02) and the annexure MBF-03 (the Index to Documents (Crop Expert) indexing the material in the Brief to Crop Expert) that, in preparing his expert report, Mr Frick reviewed data in the Brief to Crop Expert volumes. b. Mr Frick's affidavit with the annexures including the expert report had been available to the applicants since 2006. c. Mr Bell QC informed the Court that the data in the Brief to Crop Expert was already in evidence before the Court at the time Mr Frick was sworn as a witness. I accept this information, and in any event note from reviewing the Brief to Crop Expert that the following material, of which copies were included in the Brief to Crop Expert, was already in evidence by the time that Mr Frick was called as a witness: exhibits A32, A5, R30, A16, A12, A13, A17, A19, A21, A37, A39, A43, A45, A52, A30, A58, A64 and A66. d.

Case8863,referred to,May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255 ,"Counsel for Sanofi-Aventis submitted that enabling disclosure, not mere disclosure, is required for anticipation, citing, most recently, Lindgren J in Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 559 at [160] [161] and the decision of the House of Lords in SmithKline Beecham (Paroxetine Methanesulfonate) Patent [2006] RPC 323. By way of introduction, it is worth remarking that the phrase ""enabling disclosure"" was brought to prominence by the speech of Lord Hoffmann in Biogen Inc v Medeva plc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 , (1996) 36 IPR 438. That decision concerned the requirements for a valid patent under the 1997 United Kingdom Act (based upon the European Patent Convention) but did not concern the question of anticipation. The most important question was whether a later patent could claim an earlier priority date because it was ""supported"" by the earlier specification. That is a concept similar to, but narrower than, whether a later patent is fairly based upon an earlier specification in our law (cf F Hoffman-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commissioner of Patents [1971] HCA 3 ; (1971) 123 CLR 529 ; CCOM Pty Ltd v Jiejing Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1168 ; (1994) 51 FCR 260 ; Lockwood Security Products Pty Ltd v Doric Products Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 58 ; (2004) 217 CLR 274). It may be accepted that, in the case of a claim for a chemical compound by formula, in order to be valid, the specification would have to disclose how it might be manufactured (s 40). The phrase was also used in the speech of Lord Oliver in Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK's Application [1991] RPC 485 , to which I shall return. The phrase is reasonable shorthand in relation to the disclosure required for there to be anticipation of a process or method claim but, in my opinion, has little, if any, relevance to anticipation of a product claim or a claim for a chemical compound by formula. Indeed, it is apt to mislead in relation to the latter. For a product claim, the novelty must lie in the product not the means of producing it ( May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255 at 281 282). By the same token, a new process to obtain an old product will have novelty. 64 Something was sought to be made of the fact that PCR 4099 or derivative 1 was not unmistakably pointed to as the best of the compounds. There was competing evidence from the experts related to that question. In my view, that was a red herring as far as novelty is concerned. On any view, it was expressly disclosed as one of the most promising of the compounds. The invention was not limited to the most effective or most promising example. The invention was a broad class. As Lord Hoffmann lucidly explained in Biogen Inc [1996] UKHL 18 ; [1997] RPC 1 at 48 49, 36 IPR 438 at 455: ""If the invention discloses a principle capable of general application, the claims may be in correspondingly general terms. The patentee need not show that he has proved its application in every individual instance. On the other hand, if the claims include a number of discrete methods or products, the patentee must enable the invention to be performed in respect of each of them. Thus if the patentee has hit upon a new product which has a beneficial effect but cannot demonstrate that there is a common principle by which that effect will be shared by other products of the same class, he will be entitled to a patent for that product but not for the class, even though some may subsequently turn out to have the same beneficial effect: see May &amp; Baker Ltd v Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd [1950] RPC 23 at 50. On the other hand, if he has disclosed a beneficial property which is common to the class, he will be entitled to a patent for all products of that class (assuming them to be new) even though he has not himself made more than one or two of them."" 77 The first case in the United Kingdom Court of Appeal to consider selection patents was In the matter of Esso Research and Engineering Co's Application (Shell) [1960] RPC 35 where the principle was explained as follows ([1960] RPC 35 at 53): ""So it is that you may have first the scientist who discovers and discloses the whole range and who may obtain patent protection for the subject-matter of his discovery or the means of manufacturing them what Maugham, J. called the ""originating patent"". But within such a range there is room also for the second scientist whose researches may discover and disclose that certain of the items or a section of them have advantages peculiar to themselves, hitherto unknown; and, if so, then there would appear to be no ground on reason or principle why patent protection should not be, in proper cases, available to the second scientist."" (See also Institut Francais du Petrole des Carburants et Lubricants' Application, Re [1972] FSR 147, [1972] RPC 364; May &amp; Baker Ltd (1948) 65 RPC 255.)"
Case9564,cited,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-840,"It has been recognised on a number of occasions that this remedy can be a peculiarly apt one where the contravening conduct occurred in the course of a company's routine business advertising: see eg Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Australia Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41-840 at 43,382. In such cases, particularly where no injunction is to be granted, a corrective advertising order can assist in making an advertiser ""more assiduous in ensuring that it does not repeat the contravening conduct"": Prouds Jewellers (No 2) at [13]. The making of such an order would, in my view, be salutary in the present matter. 30 I acknowledge that a considerable period has passed since the offending publication was made. While this may in a given instance be a factor telling against ordering corrective advertising, here it is not. Such an order, coupled with declaratory relief rather than an injunction, provides an appropriate coercive incentive to Harbin. 31 The form of corrective advertisement I will order to be published will be in the terms of that annexed to these reasons. With one necessary modification to reflect my refusal to award injunctive relief, it follows the form proposed by the ACCC."
Case6974,applied,Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Aust) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407,"The context or setting in which a mark appears is an important consideration in determining whether it has been used as a trade mark: Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Esso Standard Oil (Aust) Ltd (1963) 109 CLR 407 at 422 ( Shell ). 17 The key witnesses and evidence relied upon by the parties were: &#8226; Mr Melville Speers, who is director of World Brands Management Pty Ltd, the first cross-respondent, and two affidavits sworn by him on 21 September 2006 and 7 April 2008 &#8226; Mr Trenear, who is Managing Director of YD, and one affidavit sworn by him on 25 May 2007 &#8226; Mr Vickery, who is a consultant and director of DawVic Pty Ltd, Footwear Consultancy, and one affidavit sworn by him on 6 July 2007.

The applicants submit that elements of Mr Trenear's evidence were unreliable, but notwithstanding this I accept his evidence as a whole. 18 The relevant market is the buying and selling of shoes. It involves shoes similar to that expressed in the Shape Mark. Diesel's shoes are sold in stores such as Myer and David Jones amongst many other retail and chain 'youth' stores.

The court must do its best to quantify the actual loss even if some degree of speculation or even possible guess work is involved in this exercise ( Aristocrat Technologies Australia Pty Limited v DAP Services [2007] FCAFC 40 per Black CJ and Jacobson). The court is not relieved from the duty of assessing the loss merely because circumstances do not admit of damages being assessed with certainty ( McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 412 per Dixon and Fullagar JJ; Enzed Holdings Limited v Wynthea Pty Limited (1984) 57 ALR 167 at p 183 per Sheppard, Morling and Wilcox JJ where their Honours said, 'The principle is clear.

Case16313,cited,The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310,"The authorities indicate that, broadly speaking, there are four recognised classes of case in which a court may grant leave to re-open, although these classes overlap and are not exhaustive. These four classes are (1) fresh evidence ( Hughes v Hill [1937] SASR 285 at 287 ; Smith v New South Wales Bar Association [No 2] (1992) 108 ALR 55 at 61-2); (2) inadvertent error ( Brown v Petranker (1991) 22 NSWLR 717 at 728 (application to recall a witness); Murray v Figge (1974) 4 ALR 612 at 614 (application to tender answers to interrogatories); Henning v Lynch [1974] 2 NSWLR 254 at 259 (application to re-open); (3) mistaken apprehension of the facts ( Urban Transport Authority of NSW v NWEISER (1992) 28 NSWLR 471 ("" UTA "") at 478; and (4) mistaken apprehension of the law ( UTA at 478). In every case the overriding principle to be applied is whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing or rejecting the application for leave to re-open: see UTA at 478; also The Silver Fox Company Pty Ltd as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 2) [2004] FCA 1310 ("" Silver Fox "") at [22] and [25]. 28 The above-mentioned considerations do not, however, persuade me to give the applicants leave to re-open. There are weightier factors militating against the grant of leave. These factors are as follows. (1) The applicants deliberately chose not to quantify the Commonwealth's loss at the first hearing, perhaps because they believed that they could not do so (see their letter of 27 August 2004) or for some other reason. This factor, though not conclusive, is a significant one. (2) Prior to the first hearing, the applicants had plainly led the respondents to believe that the applicants were proceeding on the basis that quantum was irrelevant and, in any case, that the loss could not be quantified. (3) The applicants opened and closed their case on the basis that they had not quantified their loss and did not need to do so. (4) The applicants did not make any application for a split trial, whether by the preliminary determination of a separate question under O 29 r 2 of the Federal Court Rules or otherwise, although it was open to them to do so. (5) By their correspondence and their conduct before and at the first hearing, the applicants led the respondents to understand that they had presented the totality of their evidence at the first hearing. (6) Before the first hearing, the applicants knew that it would be said against them that they could not succeed without evidence quantifying their loss. (7) The respondents prepared, planned and conducted their case on the basis that the applicants would not present quantification evidence. This factor is also significant. In the belief that the applicants were not going to present quantification evidence, Bradshaw contended that the applicants could not succeed without such evidence. As counsel for Bradshaw observed, if the applicants had provided the respondents with some evidence of the quantum of their loss, the respondents might have taken a different view of their claim for payment under the bond. Had he not been led to believe that there would be no evidence of quantification, Bradshaw would presumably have conducted his case differently. (8) Whilst there were no pleadings, the issue in debate was clearly addressed in the correspondence between the parties prior to the first hearing. (9) In circumstances where the applicants had full knowledge of the considerations relevant to their conduct and proceeded on a particular basis, the public interest in the finality of litigation weighs strongly against permitting them to depart from that basis: compare Silver Fox at [25] and the cases there cited. (10) In the circumstances outlined, a costs order is inadequate compensation to the respondents and, in any event, does not satisfactorily meet the public interest in finality of litigation. I would therefore refuse the application to reopen the applicants' case."

Case17030,considered,Re Bauhaus Pyrmont Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2006] NSWSC 543,"The respondents submit that Mr Glover's claim to ""maintain"" the privilege is said to derive from Stage 5's shareholding in the applicant, which is then said to give it an interest in the outcome of the proceeding. They contend that it is a question of fact whether, in a particular case, a shareholder has such an interest, and that in a case such as the present, where the applicant is clearly insolvent, no such interest exists because Stage 5's shareholding is valueless. They rely on Re Bauhaus Pyrmont Pty Ltd (in liquidation) [2006] NSWSC 543 ( Bauhaus ). There, one Widdup was a director of the company in liquidation and the indirect owner of all the company's shares. Justice Austin held that Mr Widdup did not have a common interest in privileged documents given to him because there was no prospect of a distribution to contributors in the winding up. 18 The respondents rely on the matters set out at [10] to show that Stage 5 stands in the same position as Mr Widdup in Bauhaus . The applicant sought to distinguish Bauhaus on the ground that it concerned a liquidator of a company giving privileged documents to a shareholder who, at the time of receipt, had no prospect of a return from the winding up. 19 Section 122(5)(b) of the Evidence Act (set out at [11]) excludes the waiver provisions of sub-ss (2) and (4) in relation to a disclosure to a person who, at the time of the disclosure , shared a common interest with the client. Accordingly, I accept the applicant's submission that common interest is to be tested at the time Mr Glover came into possession of the documents. 20 The party claiming privilege has the onus of establishing the basis of the claim. Order 33 rule 11(1) of the Federal Court Rules provides that: Where the Court, by subpoena or otherwise, orders any person to produce any document or thing, and any person makes and substantiates sufficient lawful objection to production on grounds of privilege, the Court shall not compel production of that document or thing except production to the Court for the purpose of ruling on the objection. (Emphasis added.) 21 The expression ""ground of privilege"" is defined in rule 11(5) as a ground on which a person may rely to make an objection under Part 3.10 of the Evidence Act . That includes common interest privilege. See s 122(5)(b) and Bauhaus at [24]. On onus in relation to client legal privilege in general, see Mitsubishi Electric Australia Pty Ltd v Victorian Workcover Authority (2002) 4 VR 332 at 337. The claimant must establish the facts giving rise to the privilege: National Crime Authority v S (1991) 100 ALR 151 at 158-159."
Case17243,referred to,Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142,"Even if I am wrong and the Magistrate erred in not making a finding of fraud, such a finding would not lead to the setting aside of the Tribunal's decision. The effect of fraud by a migration agent on a decision of the Tribunal was considered by the Full Court of this Court in the recent decision of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v SZFDE [2006] FCAFC 142 (' SZFDE '). Applicants for a protection visa engaged a man who said he was a solicitor with a lot of experience in migration matters. Unbeknown to the applicants he had been struck off as a solicitor and deregistered as a migration agent. He told the applicants that they should not accept an invitation to appear before the Tribunal at an oral hearing because their application would be refused. He told them that he was going to write to the Minister on their behalf and he was concerned that if they appeared before the Tribunal they might say something inconsistent with what he said in the letter. He told them not to worry, that he was doing what was best for them. The Magistrate found that the agent had acted dishonestly and fraudulently. In other word s, his advice was not only bad, but also fraudulent. A majority of the Court (Allsop and Graham JJ) said that the fraud in that case did not provide a basis for setting aside the decision of the Tribunal. The Tribunal was not aware of the fraud and had complied with the Act in terms of extending an invitation to the applicants (ss 425 , 425A ). 30 Allsop J said that the decision of the Tribunal was not induced or affected by fraud (at [136]). Allsop J made the point that in the circumstances of the case before him the fraud was linked to the complaint that there had been a failure of procedural fairness. The complaint of a lack of procedural fairness could not succeed in light of ss 422B , 425 and 426A of the Act. Allsop J also said that it was not a case where it could be said that the statutory process was corrupted by fraud (at [139]). Graham J also dismissed the challenge based on fraud saying that even if there was fraud it was of no relevance (at [191] and [237]). 31 French J dissented. His Honour held that the fraud of the agent gave rise to a jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal, saying that the Tribunal made its decision (at [131]): '... blamelessly but pursuant to a process which, unknown to it, was compromised by third party fraud.' 32 On the basis of the majority decision in SZFDE the appellant's submission that the fraud of Mr Han (assuming, contrary to my earlier conclusion, that he was fraudulent) vitiates the decision must be rejected. 33 The appellant's alternative submission was that the agent's conduct led to a breach of the rules of procedural fairness and that that gave rise to a jurisdictional error. This submission raises two questions. First, absent the particular statutory context, is there what might perhaps be called a general rule that there is a breach of the rules of procedural fairness if a party fails to attend a hearing due to the erroneous advice of his agent? Secondly, if there is such a rule, does the particular statutory context negate the rule or the granting of relief. I realise that dividing the issue into two questions is somewhat artificial, but I think it does assist in the overall analysis. 34 There are many cases in which the courts have considered whether, in the absence of fault on the part of the decision-maker, there can be a breach of the rules of procedural fairness. A number are discussed in the reasons for judgment of French J in SZFD E (see also Aronson, Dyer and Groves, Judicial Review of Administration Action (3 rd ed, 2004) pages 460-463). They can perhaps be placed in various categories depending on one or more of: the powers the Court was exercising; the status of the person at fault (ie, party's agent, other party to the proceeding or a third party); the nature of the conduct of the party at fault (ie, fraudulent or negligent); and the effect of the procedural departure. It seems fairly clear on the authorities that there can be a breach of the rules of procedural fairness in the absence of fault on the part of the decision-maker: Hot Holdings Pty Ltd v Creasy [2002] HCA 51 ; (2002) 210 CLR 438 per Gleeson CJ at 448 [22]. Equally, it seems clear on the authorities that there is no breach of the rules of procedural fairness if the fault leading to the procedural departure was that of the agent of the applicant for relief. That was the view of the House of Lords in Al-Mehdawi (supra) and of French J (at [101]-[103]) and Allsop J (at [138]) in SZFDE . The appellant's alternative submission fails on this ground. 35 The submission would fail in any event because even if there was such a general rule it could not operate in the context of the provisions of the Act. Section 422B provides that Division 4 of Part 7 is taken to be an exhaustive statement of the requirements of the natural justice hearing rule in relation to the matters it deals with. Section 425 requires that the Tribunal must invite an applicant to appear before it to give evidence and present arguments relating to the issues arising in relation to the decision under review. That invitation was given in this case. Section 426A provides that where an applicant fails to appear in response to an invitation, the Tribunal may make a decision on the review without taking any further action to allow or enable the applicant to appear before it. That is how the Tribunal decided to proceed in this case and it was entitled to do so. The conclusion that the statutory provisions allow no room for a claim that there was a breach of the rules of procedural fairness based on the erroneous advice of an applicant's agent was a conclusion reached by a majority of the Court in SZFDE (per Allsop J at [138] per Graham J at [237]-[239]). 36 The decision of the Tribunal did not involve jurisdictional error and the Magistrate's decision that the application was not competent was correct. 37 The appeal must be dismissed with costs.

Case2582,discussed,London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd [1916] 2 AC 15,"Privy Council's decision has been criticised. In Watt v Longsdon [1930] 1 KB 130 at 148, Scrutton LJ said that the decision ""must not be relied on too strongly"" in the light of the decision of the House of Lords in London Association for Protection of Trade v Greenlands Ltd [1916] 2 AC 15 ( Greenlands ). In Greenlands the House distinguished Macintosh v Dun . The case concerned the London Association for the Protection of Trade (Association) which had over 6,000 members who paid an annual subscription. A member (Kydd) applied to the Association on a form provided by it for information on the commercial standing of a trading company (Greenlands) with which Kydd proposed to deal. The secretary to the Association (Hadwen) applied to a commercial agent and debt collector (Wilmshurst) at Hereford where Greenlands carried on business for such information. Having obtained the information from Wilmshurst, Hadwen passed it onto Kydd. Greenlands sued Wilmshurst, the Association and Hadwen for libel. A jury returned verdicts against all three defendants, finding express malice against Wilmshurst. The Association and Hadwen appealed. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial as against them. On the further appeal to the House of Lords, Greenlands consented to have the judgment against the Association set aside because it transpired that it was an unincorporated association. The point of distinction that seems to be common to their Lordships' speeches is that in Greenlands the Association was an unincorporated not-for-profit association who business was carried on by a committee, which did not operate solely from motives of pecuniary gain, and Hadwen did not act as agent of the Association but as agent of Kydd. Their Lordships emphasised that whether qualified privilege was attracted depended on a close scrutiny of all the circumstances of the individual case. The present cases share some features with both Macintosh v Dun and Greenlands . Like the defendants in Macintosh v Dun : Veda is motivated by the desire for pecuniary gain; Veda is not itself in the business of providing credit but is in the different business of collecting and providing, for reward to itself, creditworthiness information sought by credit providers. On the other hand, as in Greenlands : It seems clear that if Veda had remained a mutual association it would have been indistinguishable for present purposes from the Association in Greenlands or from the association of stock salesmen in Howe and McColough v Lees . Senior counsel for Veda informed the Court that Veda ""demutualised and became a public company in the late 1990s"". He submits that it would be ""incongruous"" and would be ""the sort of thing that brings the common law into disrepute"" if such a change in formal status could cause Veda to lose the defence of qualified privilege."
Case8266,referred to,VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471,"The reference to ""information"" in s 424A does not encompass a failure to mention a matter to the Tribunal. An observation that an applicant failed to refer to a particular matter may constitute no more than an aspect of the Tribunal's reasoning concerning a deficiency in his evidence. In VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2004) 206 ALR 471 at [24], Finn and Stone JJ commented on the term ""information"": "" ... the word does not encompass the Tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations; nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the Tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps.""
